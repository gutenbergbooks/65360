</div>


<p>The authors have made every effort to
write these little stories in language that
will be intelligible to very little children.</p>

<p>They have observed that it is much easier
to hold a small child&#8217;s attention when <i>telling
stories</i>, rather than when reading them
aloud. So they have tried to put these
stories in informal English, using frequent
repetitions, with here and there an <i>interesting</i>
long word, and italicizing words on
which emphasis is to be laid, their object
being to write the stories as they would be
told.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TO READ FIRST</h2>
</div>


<p>Charlie was a little boy who lived with his
Mother and his Daddy and his Auntie in a
house in the city. The house had a big yard
all around it, where Charlie liked to play.</p>

<p>A cat called Jane and her kitten Topsy
also lived in the house. Topsy and Charlie
were great friends and they played together
all day long. Jane sometimes played with
them too, but Jane was a cat who loved little
babies, both baby cats and baby humans,
and she was sad because Charlie was growing
to be a big little boy, and Topsy was a
big little kitten&mdash;so big that he could wash
himself and it would have been <i>ab-surd</i> for
Jane to go on washing him when he was
such a big little kitten!</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1">[1]</span>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image001.jpg" alt="" /></div>





<h2 class="nobreak">BINGO COMES TO LIVE WITH
CHARLIE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE morning Charlie woke up suddenly
because his kitten Topsy had jumped
on his bed and was tickling him under the
chin!</p>

<p>Charlie woke up, and somehow he felt
different&mdash;he felt most <i>awfully old</i>&mdash;and
then he remembered why!</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m five years old!&#8221; he shouted and
jumped out of bed. With Topsy on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
shoulder, he ran downstairs to the kitchen
where his Mother and his Auntie were getting
breakfast ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m five years old!&#8221; he shouted again,
and jumped into his Mother&#8217;s arms. &#8220;I&#8217;m
a great big boy now.&#8221;</p>

<p>His Mother said, &#8220;Yes, indeed, you are a
great big boy now, think of it! It takes <i>all</i>
the fingers of one hand to tell how old you
are!&#8221; And his Mother hugged him hard
and his Auntie hugged him hard too and
they both wished him &#8220;Many happy returns
of the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Charlie ran upstairs again and
started to dress himself. He could dress
himself quite easily, but sometimes when
he was lazy he would pretend that he could
not and call out for his Auntie to button
him up.</p>

<p>But as he was five years old to-day Charlie
was going to show everybody what a big boy
he was. So he brushed his hair and cleaned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
his teeth and buttoned <i>all</i> the buttons and
came out of his room at the same time as
his Daddy came out of <i>his</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Oh, what</i> a big boy you are!&#8221; said his
Daddy. &#8220;I can hardly lift you.&#8221; But he
did lift him all the same and carried him
down the stairs and into the dining room
on top of his shoulder!</p>

<p>And when they got into the dining room
Charlie scrambled all down his Daddy without
waiting to be put down&mdash;for there were
the most ex-cit-ing looking parcels on the
table beside his plate, and one of them was
so e-nor-mous that it took up half the room
on the table!</p>

<p>Charlie could not wait <i>one</i> minute, he
started right away to take the wrapping
paper off the great, e-nor-mous parcel.</p>

<p>It was tied with blue ribbons just like the
other parcels, for all that it was so e-nor-mous.
Charlie pulled and he tugged and
at last the wrapping paper was all off.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
And what do you think it was? You never
can guess! <i>No one</i> could ever guess that
such a thing could be on the breakfast table
beside a little boy&#8217;s plate, even though it
was the little boy&#8217;s birthday and he was five
years old. It was an automobile! Yes, it
was an automobile that Charlie could sit in
and pedal with his feet, and it would go just
like a real automobile. Charlie&#8217;s Daddy
lifted it to the floor and Charlie ex-am-ined
it all over. It had real lights and a wind
shield and a steering gear. It was the most
beautiful automobile that any little boy
ever had!</p>

<p>There were a lot of other parcels beside
his plate, and they were <i>all</i> interesting.
There was a new suit for Charlie, and it
was a sailor suit, just like those that big
boys wear. It had a lanyard and a whistle,
and it had a red stripe and an emblem on
the sleeves. Then there were two new cars
for his electric train, and a pair of scissors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
with blunt edges, so that Charlie could cut
things out himself and not always have to
ask his Mother or his Auntie to do it
for him. There was an express wagon
that he could haul stones and grass in,
and there was a new battery for his flashlight!</p>

<p>Charlie was still looking at all his beautiful
presents, when there came a ring at the
door and a loud whistle. It was the postman!
Charlie ran to the front door and
opened it. And he said to the postman, &#8220;I
am five years old, and I&#8217;ve got an automobile
and a whistle just like yours, and a lot
of other things.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the postman said, &#8220;I <i>thought</i> that
you had grown a lot taller since I saw you
yesterday. It&#8217;s fine that you have got a
whistle like mine. There is nothing to prevent
you from being a postman yourself
now, is there? Then you can carry your
own mail. Look what a lot of letters I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
have brought this morning&mdash;and they are
all for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, the postman was right, <i>all</i>
the letters were for Charlie, and every letter
had a beautiful card in it wishing him
&#8220;Many happy returns of the day.&#8221; And
there was a letter from Uncle Jim; it had
a whole dollar bill in it, and the dollar bill
was for Charlie! Yes, the dollar bill
was all for Charlie, and his Mother said that
she would take him down to the stores and
he might buy whatever he liked with it.</p>

<p>Then his Daddy said, &#8220;What are you going
to buy with the dollar?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Charlie said, &#8220;I am going to buy a
present for Mother and a present for Auntie
and a present for <i>you</i>, then we will all have
presents on my birthday!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, it took such a long time opening all
his presents and looking at all his birthday
cards that it seemed as if Charlie would not
get any breakfast at all that day. But at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
last he had all his presents spread out on
the table in front of him, so that he could
look at them while he was eating his breakfast;
that is, all except the automobile, and
that was on the floor beside his chair.</p>

<p>At last he finished his breakfast and he
went into the kitchen to give Jane and
Topsy <i>their</i> breakfast, when&mdash;what do you
think? Jane wasn&#8217;t there! No, Jane was
not in the kitchen at all, or in the dining
room, or upstairs in any of the bedrooms,
nor was she in the yard. Jane had ab-so-lute-ly
disappeared!</p>

<p>Charlie and his Mother and his Auntie
called, &#8220;Jane, Jane, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!&#8221;
all over the house and all over the yard, but
no Jane came.</p>

<p>Never before had Jane been late for
breakfast, but now that she did not come
Topsy had to have breakfast all by himself.</p>

<p>Charlie felt very sad that Jane had disappeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
on his birthday. He loved Jane
very much, nearly as much as he loved
Topsy. He sat down on the floor and began
to play with his new toys, but every
few minutes he got up and went to the
window to see if Jane was coming back.
Yes, Charlie went to the window three,
four, <i>five</i> times, and there was no Jane.
The <i>sixth</i> time that Charlie looked out of
the window, what do you think he saw? He
saw Jane coming down the garden path,
and she was carrying something in her
mouth. It was something big and heavy,
four times as big as a mouse! It was so
big and heavy that Jane had to drag it along
the ground.</p>

<p>Charlie rushed to the door and called out,
&#8220;Mother! Auntie! Come quick! Jane has
come back and she has something e-nor-mous
in her mouth AND IT&#8217;S ALIVE!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he opened the front door just as
Jane reached it, and Jane dropped the thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
that she was carrying in her mouth. What
do you think it was?</p>

<p>You never can guess. IT WAS A
LITTLE, TINY PUPPY! Yes, a little
baby puppy, so little that it could hardly
walk!</p>

<p>Jane had been so sad at not having any
baby kitten to play with any more, now that
Topsy had grown to be such a big kitten,
that she had found a baby puppy instead,
and she had brought it home on Charlie&#8217;s
birthday so that it could be Charlie&#8217;s puppy
too.</p>

<p>Oh, but Charlie and his Mother and his
Auntie were excited! They picked up the
baby puppy and they stroked Jane and told
her what a good cat she was.</p>

<p>Then Charlie&#8217;s Auntie took the puppy
into the kitchen and tried to feed him with
some warm milk, but he was <i>so</i> little that he
had not learned how to drink yet!</p>

<p>So Charlie&#8217;s Mother said, &#8220;I will go to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the toy shop, and I will buy a doll&#8217;s baby
bottle. Perhaps the puppy will be able to
drink out of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she did. Yes, Charlie&#8217;s Mother put
on her hat and coat and she went to the
toy shop. She was not gone five minutes.
She hurried so fast, because she was afraid
that the puppy might be hungry.</p>

<p>When Charlie&#8217;s mother came back with
the doll&#8217;s baby bottle his Auntie heated some
nice warm milk and put it in the bottle, and
the puppy sucked and sucked just like a
baby. Yes, he sucked and sucked until he
had drunk all the milk that was in the bottle!</p>

<p>Then Charlie&#8217;s Mother put the puppy
into Jane&#8217;s basket and Jane got in also and
the puppy snuggled up close to her and
went to sleep.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/facing010.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>The Puppy Drank All the Milk</i></p>

<p>Topsy was so interested in the baby
puppy that he tried to get into the basket
also, but there was no room for him. So
he sat outside the basket and every now and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
then he patted the puppy with his paw, but
very gently so as not to wake him.</p>



<p>When Charlie&#8217;s Daddy came home in the
evening, he was most interested and most
excited to hear that Jane had brought a
puppy home to live with them.</p>

<p>He said to Charlie, &#8220;What are you going
to call the puppy? Of course, he is really
Jane&#8217;s puppy, but I think Jane means him
to be partly yours, as she brought him home
to you on your birthday. Anyway, Jane
cannot choose a name for him that <i>we</i>
would understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Charlie thought for a minute. Then
he said, &#8220;I think I will call the puppy
Bingo. The iceman has a dog and <i>his</i>
name is Bingo. I think he is such a nice
man, and Bingo is a <i>beautiful</i> name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie&#8217;s Mother and his Auntie and his
Daddy thought it a beautiful name too, so
the puppy was called Bingo. He slept in
a basket with Jane and Topsy, for Charlie&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Auntie got another basket that was big
enough for the three of them. And he took
his meals out of the doll&#8217;s baby bottle.
Jane washed him all day long and she was
as happy, as happy could be, now that she
had a darling little baby of her own again.
In fact she was as happy as if it was <i>her</i>
birthday instead of Charlie&#8217;s.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHARLIE LEARNS THE
TRAFFIC LAWS</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">NOW that Charlie had an automobile, you
may be sure that he drove in it every
single day&mdash;that is every day that the sun
was shining, for, of course, he could not
drive in the automobile when it was raining!</p>

<p>In the mornings, when his Mother and his
Auntie were busy in the house, Charlie used
to drive up and down the garden path; but
in the afternoons, when his Mother and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Auntie went for a walk, he drove beside
them in his automobile, and Bingo always
came too.</p>

<p>Bingo was growing to be a big little
puppy&mdash;he no longer drank his milk out of
a bottle. Oh, dear, no! Bingo could lap
up his milk as well as any grown-up dog.
He had a saucer to himself just like Topsy
and Jane, and Charlie gave him his breakfast
every morning and his dinner and his
supper at the same time that he gave Jane
and Topsy theirs.</p>

<p>You may be sure that Charlie enjoyed
driving in his automobile with Bingo prancing
beside him. But though Charlie drove
his automobile every morning and every
afternoon, he did not really know how to
drive it at all! No indeed! Charlie always
wanted to pedal so fast that he paid no attention
to his steering, and the automobile
went <i>wiggly, wiggly</i> all over the place.
When he was driving in the garden Charlie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
never could keep to the path, he would pedal
so fast that the automobile would run up
on the grass and into the flower beds. And
when he was out on the sidewalk with his
Mother and his Auntie, the automobile
would zigzag from left to right and from
right to left in a most <i>pe-cul-iar</i> way.</p>

<p>His Mother and his Auntie said to him
again and again, &#8220;Don&#8217;t pedal so fast,
Charlie. Go slower and try to steer properly,
some day you will crash into a lamppost
and maybe break your automobile all
to pieces.&#8221; But Charlie did not listen. He
just went on pedaling as fast as ever he
could and paid no attention to his steering
at all.</p>

<p>One day his Mother and his Auntie were
walking along the sidewalk and Charlie was
driving in front in his automobile, while
Bingo pranced along, sometimes beside
Charlie, and sometimes running back to see
what Charlie&#8217;s Mother and his Auntie were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
doing. Charlie was pedaling away as fast
as ever he could and his automobile was going
<i>wiggly, wiggly</i> all over the sidewalk.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image016.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Quite a little way in front, an old gentleman
was walking, and he was on the outer
edge of the sidewalk, as was right and
proper for him to be. He was looking at
his newspaper and he did not know that
Charlie was driving toward him, paying no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
attention to his steering and zigzagging
from left to right and from right to left
again&mdash;when suddenly, Charlie&#8217;s automobile
went crash! Bang! straight into the old
gentleman! That was dreadful!</p>

<p>The old gentleman stopped short, and,
when he had got his breath, he said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you know that automobiles should keep to
the right? Or is it possible that you are
driving an automobile and don&#8217;t know the
traffic laws?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course Charlie apologized very politely
to the old gentleman for bumping into
him, and then he had to say that he knew
nothing about the traffic laws at all. This
made Charlie feel very much ashamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; said the old gentleman.
&#8220;That is the most extraordinary thing I
ever heard! To own an automobile, and
not to know the traffic laws!&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Charlie&#8217;s Mother and his
Auntie had come up and it was very surprising&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
old gentleman seemed to know
them both very well. He shook hands with
them both and said, &#8220;This young man has
just been telling me that he does not know
the traffic laws, though I have often watched
him out of my window driving his automobile,
and the way he zigzags up and down
the pavement would be enough for him to
have his license taken away if a policeman
were to see him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie felt very sad when he heard this.
He had a beautiful license number on the
back of his automobile and he thought it
would be a dreadful thing if a policeman
were to take it away because he did not
know the traffic laws.</p>

<p>Then the old gentleman said, &#8220;I have an
automobile of my own, and it is a big one
that runs with gasoline. I would be very
glad to take you for a drive this afternoon
and teach you every traffic law there is, if
your Mother will let you come with me. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
live quite near here, so we could start right
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course Charlie&#8217;s Mother said at once
that she would be delighted if the old gentleman,
whose name was Mr. Armstrong,
would take Charlie for a drive in his automobile.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bingo, who had been jumping
around as usual, went straight up to Mr.
Armstrong and stood up on his hind legs
as if begging to go too.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Armstrong said, &#8220;Is that your
puppy?&#8221; And Charlie said, &#8220;NO, that is
my <i>dog</i>. His name is Bingo! He does
not like to be called a puppy. May he come
with us too?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong looked doubtful. He
said, &#8220;Bingo looks very much like a puppy
to me, and puppies are apt to get into mischief;
but if you are careful to keep him on
his leash and hold on tightly to him, you
may take him with us.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>You may be sure that Charlie felt very
much excited at the thought of driving in
a real automobile and learning the traffic
laws just like a grown-up person.</p>

<p>He and his Mother and his Auntie went
home and put Charlie&#8217;s automobile in the
back hall while Mr. Armstrong went round
to his garage to get his automobile. Soon
he drove up in it and Charlie climbed in,
holding Bingo firmly by the leash so that
he should not get into mischief.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong said that they had better
drive downtown as there was such a lot of
traffic there and Charlie would be able to
watch the policeman handle the traffic. On
the way Mr. Armstrong told Charlie all
about the traffic laws and the reason for
every one. He told him how an automobile
must <i>never</i> pass a street car when it has
stopped to let off passengers, and how an
automobile driver must <i>always</i> hold his arm
out when he is going round a corner, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
people crossing the street can see in which
direction he is going.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image021.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>It was all very interesting and Charlie
kept a strict lookout to see if all the automobiles
they passed were observing the
traffic laws.</p>

<p>At last they reached the business section
of the city, where there are so many automobiles
and street cars and carts that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
policeman has always to stand in the middle
of the road to direct the traffic; otherwise
people would never be able to cross the
street in safety at all.</p>

<p>Charlie thought that the policeman looked
very grand standing all by himself in the
middle of the road. And whenever he blew
his whistle, either the crosstown traffic or
the uptown and downtown traffic in turn
was stopped, as if by magic, to let the other
have the right of way. Then the people on
the sidewalk all crossed together in a crowd,
for they knew that the automobiles and
street cars would not go on again until the
policeman blew his whistle.</p>

<p>When Mr. Armstrong wanted to stop
outside a shop and it was on the left side
of the street, he drove all the way to the
next corner and he waited there until the
policeman could let him turn his car around
and drive back so that the shop was on his
right and he could stop his car close to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
sidewalk just in front of the shop. It was
a confectioner&#8217;s shop and they both went in
and Mr. Armstrong ordered chocolate and
sponge cake for them both. It was delicious!
While they were in the confectioner&#8217;s
Bingo was left tied up in the automobile.
He did not like it at all and he called
out &#8220;Yap, yap, yap!&#8221; at the top of his lungs
until Charlie and Mr. Armstrong came
back.</p>

<p>At last it was time to go home. When
they had driven into the main street again
and Charlie was turning his head this way
and that, so as not to miss a single thing
that was going on, he was so interested that
he forgot all about Bingo. Indeed, he almost
let go of his leash, he was holding it
so loosely&mdash;when, suddenly, what do you
think? Bingo gave one yank at the leash
and jumped right out of the automobile!
Yes, he did!</p>

<p>All the automobiles were slowing up for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the crossing, and the policeman was standing
quite close, but at any moment he might
signal for them to go on again.</p>

<p>It was <i>dreadfully</i> dangerous for Bingo to
be all by himself in the middle of that
crowded street with automobiles and street
cars, and carts and trucks all moving along.
Charlie was so frightened that he called out,
&#8220;Mr. Policeman, Mr. Policeman!&#8221; and the
policeman looked at him, and he saw Bingo
at the same moment and guessed what had
happened.</p>

<p>He blew his whistle three times, and all
the automobiles stopped, those going uptown
and downtown, and those going crosstown,
they all stopped <i>immediately</i>. Then
the policeman tried to catch Bingo, but he
was so frightened that he crawled right
under an automobile, and he would not
come out when the policeman called him.</p>

<p>So the policeman came up to Charlie and
said, &#8220;You had better come along with me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
If you call your dog, he will know your voice
and come out when you call him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie took the policeman&#8217;s hand and
they went in and out among the automobiles
and carts and trucks and busses, which were
all standing perfectly still, till they came to
the automobile under which Bingo was hiding.
When Bingo saw Charlie and heard
him call &#8220;Bingo, Bingo!&#8221; he came crawling
out and he was so glad to see Charlie that
he jumped high in the air, wagging his tail
and barking, &#8220;Yap, yap, yap!&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as Charlie and Bingo were safe
in Mr. Armstrong&#8217;s automobile, the policeman
blew his whistle and all the traffic,
which had been held up to rescue Bingo,
started again. And Charlie held Bingo as
tight as ever he could, so that he should not
jump out again. But I don&#8217;t think that
Bingo would have done so, even if he could
have, he had been so frightened when he was
hiding under the automobile, with so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
trucks and carts and cars around him. And
he was right to be frightened, for he would
have been in great danger if the policeman
had not blown his whistle just at the right
moment.</p>

<p>And now Charlie knew for himself how
<i>very</i> important the traffic laws are, for if
one single automobile had disobeyed the
policeman when he blew three blasts on his
whistle and had not stopped <i>immediately</i>,
Bingo might have been run over!</p>

<p>So, ever after that, when Charlie was in
his automobile he was <i>always</i> careful to follow
every one of the traffic laws that he had
learned.</p>

<p>He <i>never</i> pedaled faster than he could
steer, and he <i>always</i> kept on the right side
of the pavement so as not to run into people
by accident. When he came to a corner,
he <i>always</i> stretched out his arm to show
the direction he was going in. And, when
a street car stopped in the middle of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
road to let off passengers, Charlie always
stopped too, until it had gone on again.</p>

<p>Yes, Charlie followed the traffic laws so
carefully that the policeman, who always
stood at the Park gate, noticed it; and he
said to him one day, &#8220;As soon as you are
sixteen years old, you can come to me, and
I will see that you get a license to drive a
<i>real</i> automobile. If everybody obeyed the
traffic laws as well as you do, there would
never be any accidents at all.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HOW BINGO LOST HIS SPOTS</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">BINGO was a nice little puppy and a dear
little puppy. He played with Charlie
and Topsy all day long. He frisked around
and barked &#8220;Yap, yap,&#8221; for though he was
getting to be a big little puppy, he could
not yet say &#8220;Bow-wow,&#8221; though you may be
sure he tried to over and over again.</p>

<p>Charlie and Topsy and Bingo had lots of
fun playing together and, when Charlie was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
playing with them, Topsy and Bingo were
always good; but sometimes, when Topsy
and Bingo played alone together, they were
as bad as bad could be and got into all kinds
of mischief&mdash;especially Bingo.</p>

<p>Yes, Bingo could think up the <i>naughtiest</i>
things to do! He liked to dig in the flower
beds and bury bits of sticks that he pretended
were bones. That was lots of fun
for Bingo but very bad for the flowers!
And he liked to go into people&#8217;s bedrooms
and hide their bedroom slippers so that they
could not find them anywhere.</p>

<p>But most of all he liked to eat up the
carpet in the dining room. Oh, my goodness!
What fun Bingo did have with that
carpet! He would hold one corner in his
mouth and he would waggle his tail and
scrabble with his paws and he would growl
and growl and he would chew at that carpet
till the wonder was he did not chew it
all up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Yes, Bingo thought up all these naughty
things to do when he was playing by himself
and he also tried to imitate the things
that Topsy did.</p>

<p>Topsy was very fond of climbing, and he
could climb beautifully. He hardly ever
knocked anything down. No indeed! Topsy
could jump straight on to the mantelpiece
and walk among the ornaments and not
knock a single one down!</p>

<p>Charlie&#8217;s Mother and his Auntie did not
like Topsy to do this. They were afraid that
some day he might throw something down&mdash;but
he never did. Bingo thought that he
would love to be able to climb like that.
He looked at Topsy with admiring eyes and
this made Topsy all the more anxious to
show off.</p>

<p>Sometimes Topsy would climb up the
dining room curtains all the way to the top,
and that made Charlie&#8217;s Mother and his
Auntie very angry, because his little sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
claws made scratches on the curtains. Then
they would shake them hard so that Topsy
would have to climb down. He <i>would not</i>
learn that he must not do it again.</p>

<p>For Topsy loved to show off. He knew
that he could climb better than anybody in
the house and so he wanted to do it all
the time, and the more he did it the more
Bingo wanted to show Topsy that he could
climb as well. But of course he could
not.</p>

<p>One reason was that Bingo could not
<i>jump</i> as high as Topsy. A little dog never
<i>can</i> jump as high as a kitten. They are not
made that way. So when Bingo wanted to
climb he had to scramble up with his paws
and he always knocked against something
or other which would come down with a
crash and a bang and somebody would say,
&#8220;Oh, you bad Bingo, you have broken something
again!&#8221; It was very discouraging.</p>

<p>One day Charlie and his Mother and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Auntie had gone out. They had gone downtown
to do some shopping so they had decided
to leave Bingo at home, as one cannot
very well take a little dog into a department
store.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image032.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>So Topsy and Bingo were left all alone
with nobody to look after them but Jane,
and she was not much good, as she was feeling
very sleepy and had gone up to the attic
to sleep undisturbed.</p>

<p>Topsy and Bingo decided that they would
have a glorious time with nobody to interfere
with them, no matter what mischief
they might be up to.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>First they went into the dining room and
they had a grand time playing with the rug.
This, as you know, was one of Bingo&#8217;s
favorite games and he showed Topsy ex-act-ly
how to play it&mdash;how you pretend that
the rug is a wild animal, and how you grab
the end in your mouth and kick and scrabble
with your paws and growl in a low and
dreadful voice. Topsy thought that this
was a grand game. He liked the growling
part especially. You should have heard the
ferocious growls that Topsy made. Bingo
felt quite frightened, although he knew it
was only in fun.</p>

<p>When they got tired of that game, they
went into the kitchen to see what interesting
things they could find to do there. And,
of course, Topsy began to climb&mdash;yes, he
climbed up on everything in the kitchen except
on the kitchen stove. He was too wise
a kitten to do that. He climbed up on to the
window sill and on to the table and on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
the sink. Then he jumped up on to the
kitchen dresser and climbed to the very top
shelf, where he walked in and out among the
plates, and yet he did not knock a single
one down! Every now and then Topsy
looked down at Bingo and tossed his head,
as if to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you wish <i>you</i> could do
it, too?&#8221; Bingo was wild with excitement.
He jumped up on his hind legs and barked,
&#8220;Yap, yap, yap!&#8221; in his funny, hoarse little
voice.</p>

<p>At last he <i>determined</i> that he would
climb up on the kitchen dresser, too.
Yes, he would climb up to the very top
shelf and show Topsy that he could climb,
too!</p>

<p>There was a chair close to the kitchen
dresser and Bingo first managed to climb
up on that, then he scrambled up on to the
dresser. He felt very proud when he looked
down to the floor and saw what a height
he had climbed to. Topsy was still up on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
the top shelf looking down at him with his
head on one side.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image035.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Bingo then stood up on his hind legs and
he put his paws up on the next shelf&mdash;but,
oh, dear! Bingo was unlucky again! He
knocked against a big, round, white tin that
had FLOUR written on it in gold letters.
And it toppled right over!&mdash;yes, it toppled
right over and banged Bingo on the head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
and a lot of white, powdery stuff fell
all over him and got in his eyes. It was
awful!</p>

<p>Poor Bingo did not want to climb any
more. He jumped straight off the kitchen
dresser on to the floor, and he ran out of
the kitchen with his little short tail hanging
down. He went into the living room
and hid under the sofa&mdash;poor Bingo was
feeling very unhappy and he wanted to be
alone.</p>

<p>Soon he heard the front door open and
he heard Charlie&#8217;s voice in the hall. Charlie
and his Mother and his Auntie had come
home.</p>

<p>Charlie said, &#8220;Oh, Mother, look at those
funny white tracks all along the floor.
What do you think they can be?&#8221;</p>

<p>His Mother and his Auntie looked, and
they said, &#8220;How extraordinary! They look
like Bingo&#8217;s footprints. I wonder what he
can have been up to.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Then Bingo himself came running out
into the hall to meet Charlie. He had forgotten
his troubles and he jumped up in
the air and barked, &#8220;Yap, yap, yap,&#8221; he
was so glad that Charlie had come home
again. But when Charlie saw Bingo, he
called out in amazement, &#8220;Mother, Auntie,
<i>look</i>! What has happened to Bingo! He
has lost his spots!&#8221;</p>

<p>And it was true. Bingo had lost all his
spots! He had lost the black spot on his
head, and the ones on his ears, and the big
black spot on his back, and the little black
spot on the end of his stumpy tail! Yes,
Bingo was now white all over without a
particle of black anywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you done to yourself?&#8221; said
Charlie as he picked him up. Bingo tried
to tell him all about it, as he wriggled and
barked and tried to lick Charlie&#8217;s face.
And&mdash;lo and behold! the black spots began
to show again, first the one on Bingo&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
head, then the ones on his ears, then the big
one on his back, and last of all the little one
on his tail. But now it was Charlie who
was white&mdash;yes, he was white all down the
front of his coat!</p>

<p>Then Charlie and his Mother and his
Auntie followed Bingo&#8217;s little white tracks
to where they came from. They wanted to
discover what in the world Bingo had been
doing to get himself white all over. Yes,
they followed the tracks all the way to the
kitchen, and there they found the tin of
flour lying on the floor near the dresser&mdash;and
<i>then</i> they knew what Bingo had been
doing while they were out.</p>

<p>Oh, how Charlie and his Mother and his
Auntie did laugh at the idea of poor, fat,
little Bingo trying to climb up on the
kitchen dresser, and knocking the tin of
flour all over himself! But they were sorry
for Bingo, too, because they knew how it
must have frightened him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>So Charlie&#8217;s Auntie found Bingo&#8217;s brush,
and she took him out into the back yard
and brushed all the rest of the flour off him&mdash;all
that wasn&#8217;t on the carpet or the kitchen
floor or on Charlie&#8217;s coat! And Charlie&#8217;s
Mother swept up the flour in the kitchen,
and swept the tracks on the living-room
carpet, and she gave Charlie a whisk broom
to brush off the front of his coat. And
then she went to the ice box and got a little
bone, and she gave it to Bingo to comfort
him.</p>

<p>So Bingo was happy again after all his
troubles&mdash;but never again did he try to
climb up on high pieces of furniture, no
matter how perky Topsy looked at him and
tried to egg him on. No, Bingo was a wise
little dog now, and when Topsy climbed up
on the mantelpiece and looked down at him,
tossing his head as much as to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you wish you could climb like me?&#8221; Bingo
would jump in the air and bark, &#8220;Yap,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
yap!&#8221; Then he would stand up on his hind
legs and beg&mdash;and that was <i>one</i> thing that
Topsy did not know how to do!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHARLIE RIDES IN THE ENGINE
OF A REAL TRAIN</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE day Charlie and his Mother and
his Auntie and Topsy and Bingo and
Jane went to stay in the country.</p>

<p>It was a very interesting place where they
were going to stay in the country. What
do you think? It was the place where
Charlie&#8217;s Daddy had lived when he was a
little boy!</p>

<p>Yes, that is where they were going, and,
as it was a Saturday, Charlie&#8217;s Daddy was
going with them, too. He was not going
to live with them in the country, because on
weekdays he had to go to the office every
day. But he said that he would come down
<i>every</i> Saturday and stay in the country till
Sunday night.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>So they all went to the railway station
in a taxicab. Jane traveled in a cat basket
and Charlie&#8217;s Auntie carried her. Topsy
also traveled in a cat basket and Charlie&#8217;s
Mother carried him, but Bingo had to travel
in the baggage car and he had a ticket all
to himself because he was a dog. Charlie
thought that he ought to feel very proud.</p>

<p>When they got to the station they all went
straight through the gate to the platform,
and there the train was waiting for them.
It was a great e-nor-mous train with ever
so many coaches. First, Charlie and his
Daddy took Bingo to the baggage car, and
the baggage man fastened Bingo&#8217;s leash to
the end of a trunk and promised Charlie to
be good to Bingo.</p>

<p>Then they all got into the day car, and
the train gave a loud whistle and steamed
out of the station. My goodness! how fast
it went! Everything just seemed to go flying
past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image043.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Bingo had to travel in the baggage car</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Soon the conductor came walking down
the aisle and he took everybody&#8217;s ticket. He
was a very grand-looking man; he was tall,
and stout, and he had a beautiful blue uniform
on. He soon came to the seat where
Charlie and his Daddy were sitting, and he
took the tickets. Yes, the conductor took
all the tickets and he stuck Charlie&#8217;s
Daddy&#8217;s ticket in his hatband, but as his
Mother and his Auntie had no hatbands, he
stuck <i>their</i> tickets into the top of the seat in
front of them. Then he took Charlie&#8217;s
ticket, and he stuck it in Charlie&#8217;s hatband.
Charlie felt very proud, and he would not
take his hat off. No, he kept his hat on all
the time because he wanted everybody to see
that <i>he</i> had a ticket in his hatband just like
all the other men.</p>

<p>Then Charlie said to his Daddy, &#8220;Daddy,
what <i>ex-act-ly</i> makes the train go?&#8221;</p>

<p>And his Daddy said, &#8220;It&#8217;s the steam that
makes the engine work, and it is the engineer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
and the fireman who look after the
steam and the engine.&#8221; Then Charlie said,
&#8220;What I want to know is <i>ex-act-ly</i> what the
fireman and the engineer do when they are
making the engine go.&#8221;</p>

<p>But what do you think? His Daddy did
not know <i>ex-act-ly</i> what they did&mdash;he said
that he had never ridden on an engine in his
life, so how could he know what they did?
And Charlie&#8217;s Mother and his Auntie did
not know either. That was very surprising.</p>

<p>Well, after they had been in the big train
for about a whole hour, they came to a station
where there were a lot of tracks. This
station was called a junction, because there
were so many tracks.</p>

<p>Some of the tracks went to the North and
some to the South and some to the East and
some to the West. The train that Charlie
and his Daddy and his Auntie and his
Mother were on was going toward the
West; but now they wanted to go to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
North, so they had to change trains and go
on a train that was going toward the <i>North</i>.</p>

<p>The train was already waiting on its own
track. It was a very little train, it had only
two coaches!</p>

<p>Charlie&#8217;s Mother and his Auntie and Jane
and Topsy got into the train, and they took
Bingo with them, because, as it was such a
little unimportant train, the conductor said
that Bingo could travel in the day coach instead
of being tied up in the baggage car,
and Bingo was very glad. But Charlie and
his Daddy waited on the platform till it was
time for the train to start, and they looked
at all the interesting things about them.</p>

<p>Then a man came up. He wore overalls
and a peaked cap. And&mdash;you <i>never</i> can
guess who it was? It was the <i>fireman</i> who
helped work the engine of the train they
were going to take. And what <i>do</i> you
think? The fireman knew Charlie&#8217;s Daddy!
Yes, the fireman came up to them, and said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
to his Daddy, &#8220;Hello, Bob!&#8221; Bob was his
Daddy&#8217;s name that his Mother and his
Auntie always called him! And his Daddy
said, &#8220;Why&mdash;Hello, Bill,&#8221; and they shook
hands.</p>

<p>Charlie was <i>very</i> much surprised that the
fireman and his Daddy knew each other,
but it was not so very surprising after all.
The fireman lived in the village where
Charlie&#8217;s Daddy had lived when he was a
little boy, and where Charlie and his Mother
and his Auntie were going to live for a
whole month, and his Daddy and the fireman
had gone to the same school when they
were little boys!</p>

<p>Well, the fireman then looked at Charlie,
and he said, &#8220;And is this your boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Charlie&#8217;s Daddy said, &#8220;Yes, this is
Charlie, and you are the very man he wants
to meet. Charlie wants to know <i>ex-act-ly</i>
what the fireman and the engineer do to
make the train go&mdash;and he can&#8217;t find anybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
who knows. So go ahead and tell him
all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the fireman said, &#8220;I can do better
than that. Suppose you and Charlie take
a ride on the engine with me; then he can
see everything with his own eyes, and learn
all there is to know in case he wants to be
a fireman himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, the fireman <i>ac-tu-al-ly</i> said those
words! And Charlie&#8217;s Daddy said, &#8220;That
will be fine. I&#8217;ll just go and tell Charlie&#8217;s
Mother and his Auntie what has become of
us, so that they won&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he did so. Then the fireman, and
Charlie and his Daddy all got into the cab,
which is back of the engine, where the engineer
and the fireman sit.</p>

<p>The engineer was already sitting in his
place, which is on the right of the cab. He
was very pleased to meet Charlie and his
Daddy, but he said that after the train had
started he would not be able to speak a word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
to anybody, and nobody must speak to him.
Yes, nobody must <i>ever</i> speak to the engineer
when he is driving the engine, because if
anybody spoke to the engineer it might distract
his attention and then the train might
be wrecked!</p>

<p>All the time that the train is going the
engineer has to sit on his seat with his hand
on the throttle, which is the thing that makes
the train stop in a hurry, and all the time
he has to look out of the window to see
what the signals say, and to see that there
is nothing on the track ahead of him.</p>

<p>If he sees a green signal on the signal
post that means that the engine can go
straight ahead, but if the signal is red, then
it means &#8220;Stop&#8221;&mdash;and the engineer presses
on the throttle, and the train stops.</p>

<p>The engineer told all this to Charlie while
they were waiting for the train to start.
Then the engineer got the signal from the
man on the platform; he blew the whistle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
and the train started, and he could not say
another word.</p>

<p>Well, the fireman&#8217;s place is on the left
side of the cab, and Charlie&#8217;s Daddy sat
between him and the window, and Charlie
sat on his Daddy&#8217;s knee.</p>

<p>The fireman has to work very hard, but
when he is not working he can talk if he
wants to. This fireman was very kind, and,
when he was not working, he explained
everything to Charlie and his Daddy&mdash;but
all the time he was ex-plain-ing he had to
keep looking out of the window, too, in case
he should see anything that the engineer
did not see. There are a great many windows
in the cab of an engine&mdash;it has windows
all round, because it is so <i>very important</i>
that the engineer and the fireman shall see
all that there is to see.</p>

<p>Well, I will now tell you what the fireman
was doing all the time that Charlie and his
Daddy were riding on the engine with him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>In front of the fireman was the steam
gauge, which is a round thing like a clock,
and it has a hand like a clock hand, too, and
the steam makes the hand move&mdash;so that
you can see how much steam is coming out
of the boiler. When the steam is getting
low the hand drops, and when the hand of
the gauge drops to 150 the fireman knows it
is time to put more coal in the fire box.</p>

<p>Every time that the hand of the gauge
dropped to 150 the fireman got up and
opened a little door in the back of the cab,
which opened right into the fire box, so that
you could see the fire all red and glowing,
and the fireman scooped a great shovel full
of coal into it. The fireman told Charlie
that it was <i>very</i> important how one shovels
the coal into the fire box. It has to be shoveled
very evenly, so that it is not all black
with coal in one place and all red hot with
embers in another place. Yes, the fireman
told Charlie that it needs a lot of practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
before one can shovel the coal in just
<i>ex-act-ly</i> right.</p>

<p>Then the fireman also had to watch the
water gauge, which shows how much water
there is in the boiler.</p>

<p>When he saw by the water gauge that the
water was getting low in the boiler, then
the fireman had to turn a valve, which is a
sort of handle that starts a pump working,
and the pump pumps water into the boiler.</p>

<p>Charlie very much wanted to turn the
valve himself, but the fireman said, &#8220;No,&#8221;
that it needed a whole lot of practice before
one could pump water into the tank&mdash;as it
was <i>very</i> important just how much water to
pump. If too much cold water is pumped
into the boiler it might cool the water already
in the boiler so that no more steam
would come out&mdash;and then the train would
stop!</p>

<p>Do you think that the fireman on an engine
is a busy man? Indeed he is!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>But that is not all that the fireman has
to do. Oh, dear, no! The fireman has a lot
more work to do.</p>

<p>When the train is coming to a steep place&mdash;and
there were a lot of steep places on the
railroad that Charlie was traveling on&mdash;the
fireman has to make the fire <i>red hot</i>, so that
lots and lots of steam can come out of the
boiler. He makes the fire get hotter and
hotter until the steam gets so strong that the
&#8220;safety valve&#8221; pops off&mdash;and this shows the
engineer that there is enough steam to push
the train up the steep place. Yes, you can
see that it would need a lot of extra steam
to push a train up a steep, high hill.</p>

<p>The fireman also has to blow a whistle,
whenever the train comes to a crossing or to
the station. And when they got to the last
stop&mdash;which was the village where Charlie
and his Mother and his Auntie and Bingo
and Topsy and Jane were going to live for
a whole month&mdash;the fireman let Charlie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
blow the whistle himself! Yes, he did, and
you should have heard what a loud whistle
Charlie blew.</p>

<p>Well, at last they had come to the end of
their journey, and Charlie certainly had
learned a whole lot about engines. Yes,
Charlie had learned a whole lot more than
most people know. Of course he told his
Mother and his Auntie about everything,
so that they, too, should know all about
what the fireman and the engineer do to
make the train go.</p>

<p>And Charlie said, &#8220;Now, when I get home
to the city I will be able to play with my
train in <i>just</i> the right way. I will be able
to play that I am the fireman and the engineer,
and I will know <i>ex-act-ly</i> what they
do, and I will practice and practice being
a fireman so that I can be one when I grow
up!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BINGO AND THE ANGRY
ROOSTER</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;TOLD you in the last story how Charlie
and his Mother and his Auntie and his
Daddy and Topsy and Bingo and Jane all
went to the country together. And how
Charlie rode on the engine, which he liked
very much, but Topsy and Jane had to
travel in baskets, which they did not like
at all, and Bingo had to travel all by himself
in the baggage car, and he did not like
that either.</p>

<p>But when at last they arrived at the farm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
where they were going to stay for a whole
month, Charlie opened the baskets and let
Jane and Topsy out, and he unfastened
Bingo&#8217;s leash, and they all went exploring
together. <i>Then</i> Jane and Topsy and Bingo
were delighted. They liked the country
<i>tre-men-dous-ly</i>, and the longer they stayed
the more they liked it.</p>

<p>There were so many delightful things for
cats and dogs to do, which they could not
do in the city. Instead of long straight
roads with automobiles dashing past all the
time, there were fields and meadows to run
around in. There were tall trees for Topsy
to climb and nice muddy puddles for Bingo
to roll in, and Jane could go out for long
walks by herself without ever meeting anything
dangerous.</p>

<p>Charlie always got up very early when
he was in the country because he liked to
see the cows milked, and Topsy and Bingo
and Jane liked to see the cows milked also.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Charlie always carried three little bowls
down to the barn, and the farmer filled them
with milk straight from the cow, so that
Topsy and Bingo and Jane could have their
breakfast without waiting. This interested
them all three very much, because they
knew that at home their milk always came
out of a milk bottle which had been left at
the front door by the milkman.</p>

<p>All the time that Charlie was in the country
he was allowed to run around in the
fields and meadows all by himself, and of
course Topsy and Bingo followed him
wherever he went. It would take a whole
book by itself to tell you <i>all</i> the delightful
things that they did together.</p>

<p>Now, wouldn&#8217;t you think that Bingo, with
all the big countryside to play in, and ever
so many interesting things to do all day
long, would have been able to keep out of
mischief at least as long as he was in the
country? But no, he could not. You see,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
puppies nearly always <i>are</i> in mischief&mdash;they
are made that way. So Bingo often went
off by himself and thought of nice, mischievous
things to do.</p>

<p>One of the things that Bingo liked to do
more than anything else was to go and bark
at the chickens. That was very naughty of
him, and Charlie always stopped him when
he found him doing it. But often Bingo
would slip away from Charlie and dash
down to the chicken house and bark, &#8220;Yap,
yap, yap!&#8221; He loved to see the hens running
this way and that, clucking loudly and
calling all the little chickens who came running
to hide themselves under their Mother&#8217;s
wings. Bingo enjoyed this tremendously
and never tired of the naughty game. Of
course he never hurt any of the chickens or
the hens. Bingo was a dear, nice, little
puppy and he would never do a thing like
that, but he <i>did</i> like to watch them running
around and saying, &#8220;Cluck, cluck, cluck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
CLUCK!&#8221; Yes, it amused Bingo very
much.</p>

<p>One day Charlie was busy helping the
lady at the farm to make the butter. This is
a very interesting thing to do. Bingo
watched Charlie for a while thumping away
with the dasher, but soon he got tired of
watching and not doing anything himself,
so he decided that he would go and play
with the chickens.</p>

<p>He began to bark before he got there, and
the hens began to cluck, cluck, cluck, and
the chickens ran this way and that way and
scrambled under their Mother&#8217;s wings.</p>

<p>Bingo was so busy with his barking that
he did not notice that there was a newcomer
among the hens. This was a big white
rooster that the farmer had brought home
from the fair the night before.</p>

<p>He was an ENORMOUS rooster. He
had won a prize at the fair because he was so
big. When Bingo jumped in among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
hens, they were all so scared that they ran
around and said, &#8220;Cluck, cluck, cluck,
CLUCK.&#8221; But the rooster was not a bit
scared&mdash;no, indeed, he was most <i>indignant</i>.
He opened his beak, and Bingo heard a
TREMENDOUS sound&mdash;&#8220;Ooka-ooka-ooka-ooooooooo!
ooka-ooka-ooka-ooooooooo!
ooka-ooka-ooka-ooooooooo!&#8221; And
the rooster sprang up in the air, and flapped
his wings, and rushed at Bingo!</p>

<p>Bingo was so startled that he jumped
backwards toward the chicken house, and
the rooster dashed after him. All the hens
came hurrying up and the chickens, too,
saying, &#8220;Cluck, cluck, cluck, CLUCK.&#8221;
They seemed to be on every side! Poor
Bingo was terribly frightened, as well he
might be&mdash;because the rooster was really
very much annoyed, and he would have
pecked Bingo if he had caught him.</p>

<p>But he did not catch him. Just in the
nick of time, Bingo saw the chicken house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and he just managed to scramble in at the
door before the rooster caught him&mdash;he was
safe.</p>

<p>Yes, he was safe, but he had to stay there!
The rooster did not quite like to go in after
Bingo (you see Bingo was really very
nearly as big as the rooster), but he determined
to keep Bingo a prisoner. He strutted
solemnly up and down in front of the
chicken-house door, and every time that
Bingo would try to come out he would crow,
&#8220;Ooka-ooka-ooka-ooooooooo! ooka-ooka-ooka-ooooooooo!
ooka-ooka-ooka-ooooooooo!&#8221;
and scare Bingo so that he decided
to stay where he was.</p>

<p>Poor Bingo! it seemed to him that he had
been hours and hours in the chicken house.
He wondered if he would ever get out again.
He was sure that it was long past his dinner
hour, he felt so <i>dreadfully</i> hungry.
Poor Bingo was a very unhappy little
dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image063.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>The rooster kept Bingo a prisoner</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>At last Charlie had finished helping the
farm lady make the butter. They had
taken it out of the churn, and the farm lady
had put it in a big wooden bowl and beaten
it with wooden butter paddles so that all
the butter milk was squeezed out. She had
given Charlie some butter in a smaller bowl
so that he could finish making some of the
butter all by himself. The farm lady had
promised him that they should have it on
the dinner table and surprise his Mother
and his Auntie.</p>

<p>But it wasn&#8217;t dinner time yet, so Charlie
ran into the garden to play with Bingo&mdash;and
there was no Bingo to be seen! He
called Bingo, but Bingo did not come.
Then he decided to go down to the big barn
to look for him. As he passed near the
chicken house he heard a <i>tre-men-dous</i> commotion&mdash;&#8220;Cluck,
cluck, cluck, cluck,
CLUCK,&#8221; &#8220;Ooka-ooka-ooka-oooooooooo,
ooka-ooka-ooka-oooooooooo, ooka-ooka-ooka-ooooooooo&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
... Bingo had been trying
to get out again!</p>

<p>Then Charlie said, &#8220;Shoo, shoo, shoo!&#8221;
and the hens and even the rooster all got
out of the way, and Bingo was free again!
Oh, how glad he was! He jumped, and
pranced, and followed Charlie to the
kitchen, where his dinner was waiting for
him.</p>

<p>But never again did Bingo bark at the
chickens and chase them. He no longer
thought it an amusing game. In fact Bingo
never went near that chicken house again,
he was so afraid of that terrible rooster.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHARLIE DELIVERS MAIL FOR
THE STAGE DRIVER</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WELL, I can tell you that Charlie and
Topsy and Bingo liked living in the
country very much. There were so many
interesting things to do, and so many interesting
people to talk to, and every single
thing in the country was different from what
it was in the city.</p>

<p>Charlie had different things to eat, and he
wore different clothes. You never can
guess what kind of clothes Charlie wore
when he was in the country! Charlie wore
blue denim overalls, just like the farm workers,
and his Mother bought them for him
at the country store, which is <i>ex-act-ly</i> where
the farm workers bought theirs!</p>

<p>One day Charlie ran out to the gate before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
breakfast to mail a letter for his Auntie.
In the country there are no post boxes at
every corner as there are in the city. Oh,
no! When Charlie wanted to mail a letter
he just had to go down to the gate and put
it in the box that was fastened outside; then
he had to take out an old red tobacco tin
that was inside the mail box, tied to it by
a string, and leave it hanging outside the
box, so that the mailman would see it when
he went past and know that there was a letter
for the mail. If he did not see the tobacco
tin hanging out, the stage driver
would not stop at all&mdash;so it was very important
not to forget to hang the tobacco tin
out.</p>

<p>Well, Charlie got to the gate just as the
stage driver was driving up. When he saw
Charlie standing there, he said, &#8220;Hello,
good morning.&#8221; And Charlie said, &#8220;Hello,
good morning,&#8221; too. Then he said, &#8220;Are
you the postman?&#8221; The stage driver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
laughed. &#8220;We-e-ll, I reckon that you can
say that&#8217;s what I am, though folks here
about call me the stage driver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very interesting,&#8221; said Charlie.
&#8220;Do you know, in the city the postman
wears a gray cap and coat and trousers and
he does not drive a cart, he has to walk?&#8221;</p>

<p>The stage driver was most surprised. &#8220;Is
that so?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, I reckon there&#8217;s
lots of things they do differently in the city,
and you, being a city boy, must surely know
all about it. I certainly would like to hear
about city ways. Supposing you ask your
Mother if she would let you drive with me
this afternoon when I take the afternoon
mail up; then you can show me how they
deliver mail in the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, my goodness, but Charlie was excited!
He ran to the house so fast that he
puffed and he blowed, and, as he ran, he
called out, &#8220;Mother, Auntie! The stage
driver says that I can go with him and give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
out the letters just like a real postman in
the city! He says that I can go this afternoon,
if you say yes. Oh, Mother, oh,
Auntie, I <i>can</i> go, can&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course his Mother and his Auntie were
<i>de-light-ed</i> when they heard that Charlie
was to go and help deliver the mail just like
a real postman, and of course they both said
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; that Charlie might go.</p>

<p>Well, the very minute that Charlie had
finished his dinner, he said very politely,
&#8220;Please excuse me, I don&#8217;t want to keep the
stage driver waiting.&#8221; Then the lady where
they were boarding and his Mother and his
Auntie said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he might be excused.</p>

<p>So Charlie got his hat and his whistle,
which belonged to his sailor suit, because he
knew he would need it as he was going to
be a postman&mdash;and he ran down to the gate
as fast as ever he could. No, Charlie did
not keep the stage driver waiting. It was
Charlie who had to wait for the stage driver!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>But at last he came driving down the
road and, when he saw Charlie waiting at
the gate, he said, &#8220;Hello, young man, so you
are coming with me. That&#8217;s fine! Hop in.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Charlie hopped in and he showed the
stage driver his whistle and how he was going
to blow it just like a real city postman.</p>

<p>The stage driver said, &#8220;First we are going
to the station to get the mail;&#8221; and he
clicked with his whip and said, &#8220;Gid ap,
gid ap!&#8221; to the horses, and they <i>did</i> &#8220;gid ap,&#8221;
and their bells jingled as they trotted along
the road.</p>

<p>The station was a long way off from the
farm where Charlie and his Mother and his
Auntie were staying, but the horses trotted
so quickly, so quickly, that they got there
before the train did.</p>

<p>Charlie and the stage driver got down,
and the stage driver hitched the horses to
the post, and then they both went on to the
platform to wait for the train.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Everybody in the station talked to Charlie&mdash;even
the station master and the man in the
ticket office&mdash;and they said, &#8220;Is this the new
stage driver?&#8221; The stage driver said, &#8220;No;
this boy is the new postman and he is going
to deliver the mail for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>You can believe that Charlie felt proud
and important when he heard them talk like
that.</p>

<p>At last the train came in, and it was the
same train that had carried Charlie and his
Mother and his Auntie and his Daddy and
Topsy and Bingo and Jane to the country.
Yes, it was the very same train and the
very same engine that Charlie had ridden
on, and the fireman was there, and he looked
out of the cab and called out, &#8220;Hello,
Charlie!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, the stage driver went to the baggage
car and a lot of men were unloading
packages, and there was one great big
sack.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>Charlie asked what was in that great big
sack&mdash;and the stage driver told him that
was the mail. Yes, all the letters that
Charlie was going to deliver were stuffed
into that great big sack!</p>

<p>So the stage driver got the mail bag and
the packages on to the stage. The stage
driver carried all the big packages and
Charlie carried all the little ones.</p>

<p>Then the stage driver said, &#8220;Gid ap!&#8221; and
off they went again. First they went to
the post office and waited there a long time.
They had to wait till the postmaster had
taken out of the mail sack all the mail for
the people who lived near the post office and
who had to come and get their mail for themselves.
But at last the postmaster had finished
<i>his</i> job, and it was time for Charlie
and the stage driver to begin theirs.</p>

<p>This, of course, was the interesting part
of the drive. The stage rattled along the
road, the horses went so fast; and at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
they came to a house and the horses stopped
of their own accord.</p>

<p>The stage driver gave Charlie some letters
and told him to go and deliver them.</p>

<p>So Charlie climbed down from the stage
and he blew his whistle, one, two, three times&mdash;but
nobody came to the gate to get the
letters from the postman. No, even though
Charlie blew again and again, nobody came
at all.</p>

<p>Then the stage driver said, &#8220;I reckon the
folks at this farm are not used to city postmen.
I reckon they don&#8217;t even <i>know</i> that
that whistle means that there is mail for
them. You had better just slip the letters
in the box, the way we do in these parts,
and we&#8217;ll drive on to the next farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Charlie did as the stage driver said.
He had to stand on tiptoe because the box
was so high. He felt a little sad that nobody
had come to get the letters from him&mdash;but
it was fun putting the letters in the box.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>Then they drove on to the next farm.
This time there were a whole lot of letters
and a parcel, too. Charlie carried the parcel
himself, as it was a little one. He said to
the stage driver, &#8220;Perhaps I had better not
blow my whistle this time.&#8221; But the stage
driver said, &#8220;Oh, go ahead and blow your
whistle, you know you are a city postman
and you must do as they do.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Charlie blew on his whistle&mdash;he blew
a TREMENDOUS blast, and he blew
again and again. And&mdash;what do you think?</p>

<p>The farmer who was in the field, hoeing
potatoes, threw down his hoe and he came
running, as fast as he could run, to see what
Charlie&#8217;s whistle meant.</p>

<p>And the farmer&#8217;s wife, who was in the
kitchen frying doughnuts, the minute she
heard Charlie&#8217;s whistle, threw down her
cooking spoon and ran out of the kitchen
door to see what Charlie&#8217;s whistle meant.</p>

<p>And the cat, who was sleeping on a rocking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
chair on the porch, sprang straight up
in the air when she heard the whistle; and
<i>she</i> came tearing down to the gate to
see <i>what in the world</i> all that whistling
meant.</p>

<p>And the watch dog, who was tied up outside
his kennel&mdash;he jumped and pranced
and tried to get loose because <i>he</i> wanted to
find out what all that whistling meant!</p>

<p>And they all came rushing down to the
gate, except the dog, and when they saw
Charlie with the parcel and the letters&mdash;my
goodness, they were surprised!</p>

<p>The farmer said, &#8220;Well, well, to think
that we have a postman just the same as
they have in the city&mdash;well! well!&#8221; and he
shook hands with Charlie.</p>

<p>Then the farmer&#8217;s wife said, &#8220;Mr. Stage
Driver, couldn&#8217;t you wait a minute while I
run into the house and get a doughnut
apiece for you and the postman?&#8221; The
stage driver thought that would be very nice&mdash;so
the farmer&#8217;s wife brought the doughnuts
and they were <i>delicious</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image077.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Charlie blew a tremendous blast</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Then they said, &#8220;Good-by&#8221; to the nice
farmer and his wife and thanked her for the
delicious doughnuts, and off they went to
the next farm. Charlie blew his whistle, and
he blew his whistle every single time they
came to a farm, but nobody else came to the
gate to see what was the matter; so Charlie
put the letters in the box every time.</p>

<p>Soon they came to a long stretch of road
where there were no houses at all, and
Charlie and the stage driver could talk together
without being interrupted every
minute by Charlie having to deliver letters.</p>

<p>Charlie told the stage driver all about
the city and about his Mother and his Auntie
and his Daddy, and about Jane and Topsy
and Bingo, and about the iceman and the
postman, and the letter boxes that are at
the corner of the streets where you mail
your letters.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>Then the stage driver told Charlie all
about the country and what an important
person the stage driver is when he lives in
the country&mdash;even more important than the
postman. For the stage driver not only
brings letters, and parcels for birthdays or
Christmas, he brings <i>everything</i> that the
people in the country need&mdash;clothes, and
furniture, and medicine&mdash;every single thing
that they use, except what they grow
themselves.</p>

<p>Everything is sent from the city by the
train in great big packages. And the stage
driver puts the packages on to the stage, and
carries some of them to the country store,
where the people can come and buy the
things they want&mdash;but some of the things go
directly to the farmers who live too far from
the country store.</p>

<p>Charlie thought this very interesting.
There were a whole lot of questions that he
wanted to ask. But now they had come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
another farm and there was a great big
package all ready at the gate!</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image081.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Charlie and the stage driver talked together</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>The stage driver got down and put it
on to the stage. Charlie was much surprised.
He said, &#8220;I thought you brought
packages <i>to</i> people, I did not know that you
took any away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the stage driver said, &#8220;I reckon you
can&#8217;t guess what is inside <i>this</i> package and
where it is going to be sent. Why, this
package is full of maple sugar, and it is going
to be sent to the city because people
could not get maple sugar in the city unless
the people in the country sent it to
them. This package is going to a big store
in the city, and when you go back home,
maybe you and your Mother will go
into the store and buy a pound of this
very same maple sugar that is in this package!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, that is what the stage driver said,
and Charlie was so interested and surprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
that the stage driver started to surprise him
some more.</p>

<p>&#8220;See all those pretty blossoms on the apple
trees. Well, by Fall they will all have
turned into apples. Then the farmer will
gather them off the trees, and he will put
them in sacks, and I will take them to the
station on my stage and load them on to
the train, and they will be taken to the city,
where you city folks will buy them. Same
thing with the wheat growing in the fields,
and the vegetables, and everything the
farmer raises. Everything that he doesn&#8217;t
need for his own use the farmer sends to the
city, first by the stage driver and then by
the train.&#8221;</p>

<p>My goodness! This gave Charlie a lot to
think about! He said, &#8220;I think that trains
and mail stages are the most interesting
things in the world. I will either be a stage
driver or a fireman when I grow up, and I
will take things to the country people that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
<i>they</i> need and bring back things to the city
people that <i>they</i> need.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time <i>all</i> the letters and <i>all</i> the
packages had been delivered. And the
stage driver was driving back the way they
came.</p>

<p>At last they came to the farm where
Charlie was staying. And the stage driver
said, &#8220;Here is one more letter for you to deliver,
and then your job will be finished.
You have been a great help to me to-day.
I think you are a fine postman and I hope
you will come with me another day and deliver
the mail for me. This letter is for your
Mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Charlie thanked the stage driver and
climbed down from the stage. He ran all
the way to the house; then he rang the bell
and blew his whistle just as the postman did
at home. And who do you think opened the
door? It was his Mother.</p>

<p>She said, &#8220;Good afternoon, Postman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
have you a letter for me?&#8221; And Charlie
said, &#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; just like the postman.
Then he couldn&#8217;t help laughing, and he forgot
that he was the postman, and he hugged
his Mother and said, &#8220;Is it a letter from
Daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>And it <i>was</i>. Yes, it was a letter from
Daddy, and what do you think? The letter
said that Daddy found that after all he
would be able to get away from the city&mdash;and
that he would arrive on Friday afternoon,
and Charlie was to be sure to come
and meet him.</p>

<p>Then Charlie&#8217;s Mother hugged him again
for bringing her such a nice letter and his
Auntie came downstairs, Topsy and Bingo
prancing after her. Bingo jumped up and
down and Topsy climbed on to Charlie&#8217;s
shoulder, and they all listened to the adventures
he had had that afternoon when he was
a postman.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHARLIE MAKES A POOL AND
SAILS HIS BOAT</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALL the time that Charlie and his Mother
and his Auntie were living in the
country Charlie&#8217;s Daddy came down every
single Saturday to visit them, and he stayed
in the country with them until Sunday night,
when he had to go back to the city. And
every Saturday, when Charlie&#8217;s Daddy
came to visit them in the country, he <i>always</i>
brought a present for everybody!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>One Saturday Charlie&#8217;s Daddy came and
he brought Charlie&#8217;s Mother a basket of
peaches, and he brought his Auntie a box
of candy, and he brought Bingo a ball, and
he brought Jane and Topsy a catnip mouse&mdash;and
what do you think he brought for
Charlie? I will tell you. Charlie&#8217;s Daddy
brought Charlie a sailboat! It was a beautiful
boat, painted white with a green water
line. It had a mast and two sails. His
Daddy told Charlie that the big sail at the
back is called the <i>mainsail</i> and that the stick
that holds it out at the bottom is called the
<i>boom</i>; and that the little three-cornered sail
in front is called the <i>jib</i> and the stick to
which it is fastened is called the <i>bowsprit</i>.</p>

<p>Of course Charlie&#8217;s Daddy did not say
&#8220;the front and back&#8221; of the ship either. Oh,
dear, no! Charlie&#8217;s Daddy called the front
part of the ship the <i>bow</i>, and he called the
back part the <i>stern</i>, and the bottom of the
ship he called the <i>keel</i>&mdash;and, I can tell you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
<i>nobody ought to own a ship who does not
know these things</i>.</p>

<p>Well, of course, the very first thing that
Charlie wanted to do was to go and sail
his boat&mdash;but what do you think? The
brook was so shallow and full of stones that
there was no place deep enough to sail the
boat at all! That was very sad.</p>

<p>Charlie and his Daddy walked a long way
beside the brook looking for a pool where
the water was deeper, but they could not
find one.</p>

<p>Then Charlie&#8217;s Daddy said, &#8220;Well, unless
some rain comes to make the brook get
deeper, I guess you&#8217;ll have to wait to sail
your boat till you come back to town and
can sail it in the bath tub. As long as you
are in the country you will have to say that
the boat is in &#8216;dry dock.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>But what do you think? Charlie didn&#8217;t
even know what a dry dock <i>is</i>. No, his
Daddy had to explain to him all about it&mdash;how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
the ship is put into &#8220;dry dock&#8221; when
it has to be mended or painted below the
water line. First the ship sails into the dock,
and then the dock is closed up behind the
ship and all the water is pumped out and
the ship is propped up straight with props
from each side of the dock.</p>

<p>So Charlie and his Daddy made a dry
dock for his ship on the bureau in his room.
They made the dock of books, and propped
the ship up straight with blocks on each side
of the keel. The ship looked very beautiful
on the bureau, but Charlie <i>did</i> wish that he
could sail it and that he did not have to
keep it in &#8220;dry dock&#8221; all the time.</p>

<p>One day, when his Daddy had gone back
to town, Charlie and his Mother and his
Auntie went for a walk.</p>

<p>They went for a new walk. Instead of
just going along the road, they thought it
would be interesting to follow the creek. So
they climbed a wall and followed the creek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
through the fields and into a wood which
was &#8220;private property&#8221;; but there was a
sign which said people could walk there if
they did not do any damage.</p>

<p>Then they came to a place where there
was a stone wall built right across the creek
from side to side and above the stone wall
was a great <i>e-nor-mous</i> pool! And the
water pounded over the stone wall like a
waterfall. The pool was very deep and
wide, but above the pool the creek was all
stony and shallow again.</p>

<p>Charlie was very much interested. He
said, &#8220;Why is that stone wall built across
the creek, and what makes that pool so deep
and broad when the rest of the creek is shallow
and narrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then his Mother explained to Charlie all
about it. She explained to him that the pool
was a swimming pool, and that the stone
wall built across the creek from side to side
was a <i>dam</i>. The dam keeps the water in like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
a basin until it gets as deep as the dam is
high and then the water flows over the top.</p>

<p>Charlie was <i>very much interested</i> when
he heard this. He said to his Mother, &#8220;Can
anybody build a dam?&#8221;</p>

<p>And of course his Mother said that anybody
could. She said that you only had to
heap a lot of mud and stones together just
below where you wanted the pool to be, and
just as high as you wanted the pool to be
deep.</p>

<p>Oh, my goodness! Charlie <i>was</i> excited
then. I wonder if you can guess what he
said?</p>

<p>I will tell you. Charlie said, &#8220;Mother,
Auntie, I want to go home <i>im-me-di-ate-ly</i>,
I AM GOING TO BUILD A DAM!
Yes, I am going to build a dam across the
brook and make a great ENORMOUS
pool to sail my boat in.&#8221; Of course his
Mother and his Auntie said they would go
home immediately when they heard that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Charlie was going to do such an important
thing.</p>

<p>So they did go home, and Charlie put on
his overalls and he ran down to the brook
and began to work at his dam.</p>

<p>First he found a place where the brook
was a little wider and where the banks were
quite steep. Then he started scooping out
the stones at the bottom of the brook, so that
there would be no rocks for his boat to get
wrecked on.</p>

<p>You may be sure that Bingo and Topsy
were very much interested in what Charlie
was doing. Yes, they both came and
watched him awhile. Then Topsy began to
dig a hole in the grass&mdash;he wanted to show
that <i>he</i> could dig a hole just as well as
Charlie could. Bingo tried to dig a hole,
too, but he soon got tired of it and ran
around and barked, &#8220;Yap, yap!&#8221; He
wanted Charlie and Topsy to come and play
with him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>But Charlie was much too busy to pay
any attention to Bingo. He just went on
bending over the brook, digging out the
stones until he had the bottom of the brook,
where his pool was going to be, nicely
cleaned out. Then he started to work on
the dam.</p>

<p>First Charlie hunted around until he had
got together a nice lot of flat stones, and he
began to pile them up one on top of the
other, and he went on piling them up until
the dam went right across the brook from
bank to bank.</p>

<p>At first the water paid no attention to
Charlie&#8217;s dam at all. It just went on flowing
through the chinks between the stones,
just as if there were not any dam there at
all! But Charlie piled up great banks of
mud, and put in more big stones and then
little stones to fill the chinks&mdash;and at last
the water began to rise!</p>

<p>Yes, the water rose, and it rose until it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
was a nice big pool and came up to the top
of the banks on both sides, and then it began
to dribble over the top of the dam. So
Charlie knew that the dam was finished!
Of course the water in the pool was
<i>dreadfully</i> muddy, but Charlie did not mind
a bit. Why should he, when the pool was
so nice and wide and deep? Yes, it was
so deep that it came all the way up to his
knees!</p>

<p>Then Charlie saw his Mother and his
Auntie walking across the field from the
house. They had come to see how Charlie
was getting along with his dam.</p>

<p>And, my goodness, how astonished they
were when they saw that Charlie had <i>ac-tu-al-ly</i>
finished the dam and what a huge
big pool he had made!</p>

<p>But both his Mother and his Auntie could
not help laughing when they saw how
Charlie was all covered with mud. He had
mud all over the front of his overalls, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
on his hands, and there was a big splash of
mud on the end of his nose!</p>

<p>Then his Mother said, &#8220;Now, Charlie, dinner
will soon be ready, so you must hurry
home and wash your face and hands, and
put on a clean suit. Then after dinner you
may sail your boat in your beautiful big
pool.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Charlie ran to the house, and he
washed his face, and he scrubbed his hands,
and he put on a clean blue sailor suit, and
he ate his dinner.</p>

<p>Then he gave Topsy and Bingo and Jane
their dinner. And then&mdash;he and his Mother
and his Auntie went down to the pool to sail
the boat. And, what do you think? The
mud had all settled at the bottom of the
pool while Charlie was eating his dinner,
and the pool was as clear as glass so that
you could see to the very bottom and you
could see the dam that Charlie had built.</p>

<p>Then Charlie launched his boat. The pool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
was deep enough&mdash;but the boat did not sail
quite well even yet. No, the boat leaned
a little to one side and, when a gust of wind
came, it would have turned right over if
Charlie had not caught hold of the mast just
in time.</p>

<p>Charlie felt very sad that his boat would
not sail properly when he had built such a
beautiful pool for it.</p>

<p>But his Auntie said, &#8220;Cheer up, Charlie,
I know exactly what is the matter with the
boat so that it will not sail, and it can be
fixed so that it will sail <i>beautifully</i>. The
trouble is that the boat has not enough <i>ballast</i>.
That means that the masts and the
sails are too heavy for the keel. But if we
nail a strip of lead along the bottom of the
keel the boat will stay upright and will not
lean to one side.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, Charlie and his Auntie took the
boat and went to the barn, where the farmer
was mending his mowing machine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>And his Auntie asked the farmer if he
knew where they could get a strip of lead
to nail to the keel of Charlie&#8217;s boat.</p>

<p>The farmer said, &#8220;Right here I have all
the lead that you can use.&#8221; And he cut off
a strip of lead just the size of the keel.
Then the farmer also gave Charlie some interesting-looking
nails that he said could
be just the thing to nail the lead to the
keel. They were crooked nails that folded
over and looked just like tiny croquet
hoops.</p>

<p>Then Charlie&#8217;s Auntie took the mast and
sails off, and she hammered the nails over
the lead so that it was fastened to the
keel of the boat. Then she put the masts
and sails back. Don&#8217;t you think that
she was a clever Auntie? Yes, indeed, she
was.</p>

<p>So they went back to the pool again,
where Charlie&#8217;s Mother was waiting to see
if the boat would sail right <i>this</i> time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image099.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><i>The boat sailed beautifully</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>And what do you think? <i>It did!</i> Yes,
the boat sailed beautifully, it sailed right
away to the other side of the brook, and
when Charlie turned the rudder to the right
the boat turned in the opposite direction
and sailed right back again!</p>

<p>Yes, that boat could do everything that
a real boat does, and when the wind blew
hard it keeled over to one side but it did not
capsize. No, nothing could make that boat
capsize. Even when Bingo stood upon his
hind legs and tried to catch it when it went
sailing past, he fell splash into the pool and
made a great ENORMOUS wave, just
like the waves in the middle of the ocean&mdash;<i>still</i>
that boat did not capsize.</p>

<p>Well, every day after that Charlie sailed
his boat in the pool. He made a dock for
it, with stones, and he put grass and pebbles
on the deck for the cargo, which he loaded
and unloaded at the dock, and the boat
sailed from side to side of the pool. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the boat got to the other side Charlie would
jump across the brook where it was narrow
and turn the rudder so that the boat would
turn right round and sail back again to the
dock.</p>

<p>Yes, Charlie had more fun than I can
tell you playing with his boat. And Topsy
and Bingo played, too; they jumped across
the brook backwards and forwards and they
tried to catch the boat as it sailed past.
And, Charlie&#8217;s Mother and his Auntie liked
to help Charlie sail his boat; yes, they enjoyed
watching it sail so beautifully before
the wind.</p>

<p>And&mdash;on Saturday, when Charlie&#8217;s
Daddy came down to visit them all&mdash;my
goodness! he was surprised and <i>de-light-ed</i>
to see the dam and the pool that Charlie had
made all by himself, and to see how beautifully
the boat sailed, with its sails blown
out by the wind, and with its cargo of grass
and pebbles piled up on deck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>Yes, Charlie&#8217;s Daddy thought that
Charlie was a very clever boy to have made
that dam and that pool all by himself&mdash;and
I think so, too.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHARLIE BUILDS A REAL
HOUSE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WELL, the days passed and passed&mdash;and
at last it was time for Charlie
to go back to the city. He said &#8220;Good-by&#8221;
to the stage driver and to the postmaster
and to the man at the country store and
to the lady at the farm, where he and his
Mother and his Auntie lived while they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
were in the country. And he said &#8220;Good-by&#8221;
to the cows and to the chickens and
to the baby pigs.</p>

<p>Charlie&#8217;s Mother and his Auntie packed
the suitcase and the trunk and put Topsy
into his basket, and he did not like it at all
and said &#8220;Miaouw, miaouw!&#8221; And Jane
was put into <i>her</i> basket and <i>she</i> did not like
it either, but she was a good cat and she did
not say a word. Then Charlie put the leash
on Bingo&#8217;s collar and they all climbed into
the surrey, which is a two-seated carriage,
and they all drove to the station. Then
they all got on to the train and off they
went to the city.</p>

<p>This time there was another fireman, as
Charlie&#8217;s friend was having a day off, so
Charlie did not ride on the engine <i>this</i> time;
no, <i>this</i> time he rode in the day coach with
his Mother and his Auntie and Topsy and
Bingo and Jane.</p>

<p>Charlie was feeling rather sad that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
to leave the country and all his new friends,
but as the train steamed farther and farther
away, he began to think that it was rather
nice to be going back to the city after all.</p>

<p>It would be nice to see his Daddy again
and the iceman&mdash;and he wanted to tell the
postman all about the stage driver and how
letters are delivered in the country. And
Charlie wanted to see his house again, where
he lived, and the garden and his electric
train and his automobile and his great
<i>e-nor-mous</i> flashlight. Yes, Charlie began
to feel very glad that he was going home
again.</p>

<p>And&mdash;when Charlie <i>did</i> get home, what
do you think he found? Why, Charlie
found that something <i>most</i> interesting and
ex-cit-ing had been happening while he was
away in the country. Some builders had
started to build a house on the other side
of the road, and he could sit on his own
front gate and watch them build.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>The builders had already built quite a
lot of the house, and in front of what they
had built was a big pile of bricks and also
a pile of sand and quicklime to make mortar
of.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/facing107.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Charlie Watched the Builders</i></p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon, so the builders
had stopped working, but Charlie
wanted to stay right there and look at everything.
But his Mother and his Auntie said,
&#8220;No.&#8221; They said that it was getting late
and Charlie must come right in and have
his supper and go to bed. To-morrow he
could watch the builders build as much as
ever he wanted to.</p>

<p>So the next day Charlie ran out <i>immediately</i>
after breakfast. The builders were
already at work&mdash;they were working hard,
putting the bricks on top of each other.
Charlie saw how they put each brick on top
of two others, he saw how they did it <i>very
carefully</i> so that the brick was <i>ex-act-ly</i> in
the middle of the two below it. Then he saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
how carefully the builders put the mortar
on with a flat, wide knife, so that none of
the mortar dripped over the edge of the
bricks but made a nice straight line up and
across. And, because the bricks were laid,
one in the middle of the two below, the
white line of the mortar made a most interesting
design.</p>

<p>Charlie was <i>ab-so-lute-ly</i> fascinated, he
thought that he would <i>never</i> get tired of
watching those builders build.</p>

<p>Then Topsy and Bingo came out to see
what Charlie was doing and to get him to
play with them, but Charlie was <i>much</i> too
interested in watching the house being built,
so he paid no attention at all. No, he paid
no attention to Topsy and Bingo, but went
on watching the builders build the house.</p>

<p>After a while one of the builders looked
up, and he said, &#8220;Hello, you seem to like
watching us build this house; I guess you
would like to be over here helping us.&#8221; And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Charlie said, &#8220;Oh, yes, I <i>would</i> like to come
over and help you, I mean to be a house
builder when I grow up.&#8221; Then the builder
said, &#8220;Is that so? Have you had any practice
in building houses?&#8221; Charlie said, &#8220;No,
I have never built a <i>real</i> house, but I can
build <i>beautiful</i> houses with my wooden
blocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the builder said, &#8220;Well, I guess you
need more practice than <i>that</i>&mdash;you have to
know how to put the mortar on, and that is
not as easy as it looks. How would you like
me to give you some bricks and mortar and
then you can build yourself a house in the
corner of your yard?&#8221; Yes, the builder
<i>ac-tu-al-ly</i> said that to Charlie! And he also
asked him, &#8220;Have you an express wagon
that you can haul the bricks in?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course Charlie said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and he
ran off to the house to tell his Mother and
his Auntie all about the house builder, and to
ask if he might go across the road by himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
to get the bricks. And his Mother and his
Auntie both said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; They said that it
would be perfectly safe for Charlie to go
across the road all by himself, because no
automobiles were allowed on the road and
there was a sign which said, &#8220;Closed to
Traffic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Charlie got his express wagon and
he went across the road to get the bricks.
He loaded the bricks into his express wagon
and he dragged them across the road and
in at the garden gate to the corner of the
garden where there were no flowers and no
vegetables. Charlie did this over and over
again; he did it so often that his legs ached,&mdash;and
every time that Charlie went across
the road Topsy and Bingo followed him.
When Charlie had been across the road four,
five, <i>six</i> times getting his express cart full
of bricks every time, the builder said, &#8220;Now
you have enough bricks to start with. Suppose
you go now and ask your Mother for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
pail and I will give you some mortar, already
mixed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie ran and got the pail, and the
builder filled it with mortar and carried it
over to Charlie&#8217;s yard himself because it was
too heavy for Charlie to carry. The builder
certainly <i>was</i> a nice man.</p>

<p>Of course Charlie wanted <i>immediately</i>
to start in building the house. But his
Mother and his Auntie said, &#8220;No.&#8221; They
said that Charlie had worked enough for one
day, and that he had better play a little.
And his Mother said, &#8220;You had better wait
till your Daddy comes home before starting
to build your house; I think you ought to
ask his advice as to exactly where would
be the best place to build it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie thought that his Mother was right
and he determined to wait till his Daddy
came home before building the house. So
he went off and had a lovely game with
Topsy and Bingo.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>At last Charlie&#8217;s Daddy came home.
Charlie was watching for him out of the
dining-room window. As soon as he saw his
Daddy come in at the gate, Charlie ran out
to meet him and to tell him all about the
bricks that the builder had given him and
about the house he was going to build.</p>

<p>Charlie&#8217;s Daddy was very interested; he
was so interested that he said he would like
to help Charlie to build the house. Then
Charlie&#8217;s Daddy went upstairs and changed
into his old suit, the one he always wore
when he was digging in the garden, and he
found a spade, and he said, &#8220;Come on,
Charlie, let us start building the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they went into the garden and started
to build the house. First Charlie&#8217;s Daddy
dug a trench, the size that the house was
to be; this was to be the foundation so that
the house should not blow over in a wind-storm.
Charlie helped dig the trench
also. It was very hard work digging the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
trench&mdash;it was such hard work that both
Charlie and his Daddy were puffing and
blowing before they had finished digging.
But at last the trench was finished, and
while they were both standing still to admire
it Charlie&#8217;s Auntie came and called them in
to supper.</p>

<p>So they both had to go in and change
their clothes and eat their supper and, by
the time that supper was over, it was too
dark to work at the house any longer.
Charlie did not like this at all, he said, &#8220;I
do not want to stop for a single minute until
the house is built.&#8221;</p>

<p>But his Daddy said, &#8220;Cheer up, Charlie,
to-morrow is a legal holiday, and I shall
be home all day. So I shall be able to help
you build your house until it is finished.&#8221;
Then Charlie was satisfied and he went to
sleep the minute he got into bed&mdash;and all
night long he dreamed about the beautiful
house he was going to build.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>The next morning both Charlie and his
Daddy got up early; they got up at six
o&#8217;clock! They each had a glass of milk and
a cookie, then they went into the garden and
began to work.</p>

<p>First they started piling bricks into
the trench, one on top of two others, <i>ex-act-ly</i>
the way Charlie had seen the builders
doing it; and his Daddy showed him
how to put the mortar on each brick with
a flat trowel that he had found in the woodshed
and that looked <i>ex-act-ly</i> like the
one the builders used. It is very important
to put the mortar on right, as
that is what makes the bricks stick together.</p>

<p>Before breakfast Charlie and his Daddy
had <i>ac-tu-al-ly</i> finished the foundation!
Charlie was very glad that he had his Daddy
to help him&mdash;why, if it had not been for
his Daddy I don&#8217;t think that Charlie would
have thought of building <i>any</i> foundation for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
his house, and then it would have blown
down!</p>

<p>Well, you may be sure that the moment
they had finished breakfast, and when
Charlie&#8217;s Daddy had smoked just one cigarette,
they both of them were hard at work
on the house again.</p>

<p>For one reason Charlie was sorry that it
was a legal holiday, and that was because
the builders were having a holiday, too, and
Charlie <i>would</i> have liked them to see him
in his overalls that were all covered with
mortar and pink with brick dust&mdash;so that
he looked <i>ex-act-ly</i> like a real builder.</p>

<p>Well, they worked and they worked.
And you never can guess how clever
Charlie&#8217;s Daddy was. He was just as
clever as a real builder. Yes, Charlie&#8217;s
Daddy <i>ac-tu-al-ly</i> knew how to make a window
in the house&mdash;and a door also! The
window went all the way to the top of the
roof and so did the door, for Charlie&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Daddy said that there was <i>one</i> thing he did
not know how to do that a real builder
knows, and that is how to make an arch, with
a keystone! Soon the house was tall enough
for Charlie to go in at the door, and then
his Daddy said that the front of the house
was tall enough. But the sides had to be
built sloping higher toward the back so that
the roof should slope&mdash;it is very important
that a house should have a sloping roof so
that the water may drain off it when it rains.</p>

<p>At last his Daddy said, &#8220;There, the house
is finished, all but the roof!&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie <i>was</i> excited! He jumped and he
shouted, &#8220;My house is nearly finished, my
house is nearly finished!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then his Daddy went off to the woodshed
and he brought back a whole lot of boards
and a roll of tar paper. He put the boards
all across the roof and covered them with
tar paper&mdash;and THE HOUSE WAS
FINISHED!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Yes, it was <i>ac-tu-al-ly</i> finished. It had a
beautiful doorway, and a window and a roof&mdash;anybody
could see that it was a real house.</p>

<p>Topsy and Bingo were nearly as much
excited as Charlie. Bingo ran in and out
of the door and barked and barked. But
Topsy climbed up the wall and in at the
window and he did this again and again.</p>

<p>Then Charlie&#8217;s Mother and his Auntie
came to look at the beautiful house. And,
my goodness! they <i>were</i> surprised that
Charlie and his Daddy had built a house
that looked exactly like a real house.</p>

<p>And Charlie&#8217;s Mother said, &#8220;Now, we
will go back to the house and we will bring
Charlie&#8217;s little chairs and his table, and I
will get a rag rug that is in the attic; then
the house will be furnished and Charlie can
live in it with Topsy and Bingo and Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>So that is what they did! And Charlie&#8217;s
Auntie hung some curtains across the window
and tied them with blue ribbon, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
his mother put the rag rug on the floor, and
placed the furniture around the room so that
it looked <i>most</i> cozy and <i>most</i> comfortable.</p>

<p>Well, just when everybody was standing
and admiring the house, Jane the cat came
up, and she looked at the house for a minute.
Then she walked straight in at the
door and lay down on the rug, and she
purred and purred as loud as she could purr,
because she liked Charlie&#8217;s house so tremendously.
But Topsy jumped in at the
window and <i>he</i> walked around the house and
sat down on every one of the little chairs
and even on the table, but when he jumped
into the express cart, which was in the corner
of the house, he liked it so much that he
curled up and went to sleep. But Bingo
was the most excited of all&mdash;he dashed
around and around the house, and he
jumped up in the air and barked and barked
and BARKED!</p>

<p>The next day, when the builders were at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
work again, Charlie climbed up on the gate
and called out to the builder who had given
him the bricks, &#8220;Good morning, Mr.
Builder! I have finished my house!&#8221;</p>

<p>The builder was most interested and he
came over to look at the house that Charlie
had built.</p>

<p>He said, &#8220;Did you build that house <i>all</i>
by yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Charlie said, &#8220;Yes, I built that house
<i>all</i> by myself, and my Daddy helped me.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BINGO LEARNS TO COME WHEN
HE IS CALLED</h2>
</div>


<p>Bingo was a very clever little dog&mdash;he
learned very quickly all the tricks that
Charlie taught. He could sit up and
beg, and he could bark three times for the
flag, and when Charlie put a piece of cake on
his nose Bingo could toss it in the air and
catch it in his mouth, and, if Charlie threw a
stick, Bingo would always run and bring it
back. Yes, Bingo could do all these things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
and he liked to do them again and again.
He was such a clever little dog that all the
boys in the neighborhood knew him well, and
they used to watch him over the fence doing
all the tricks that he had learned.</p>

<p>But there was <i>one</i> thing that Bingo never
<i>would</i> learn and that was to come <i>immediately</i>
when he was called. If Bingo
thought that Charlie was going for a walk
or that his dinner was ready, he would come
the very minute that Charlie called him; but
if he was doing something interesting or
something that he should not be doing,
Charlie could call &#8220;Bingo, Bingo, Bingo,&#8221;
till he was hoarse, Bingo would not come!
He would wag his tail and perk up his ears
to show that he had heard, but he would not
come.</p>

<p>One day Charlie was playing in the garden
with Bingo and Topsy when Bingo
suddenly saw something that interested him
in the road and he scrambled under the gate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
and went scampering along down the road.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image122.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Charlie did not approve of this at all.
He called and he called, &#8220;Bingo, Bingo,
Bingo&#8221;&mdash;but Bingo would not come, he
went on racing along the road. He had
decided that he would like to go out and see
the world!</p>

<p>Then Charlie ran into the house to tell
his Mother and his Auntie. He could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
run after Bingo, because of course he was
not allowed to go outside the garden gate by
himself. His Auntie did not even wait to
put on her sweater though it was very cold;
she ran straight out of the gate to bring
Bingo back&mdash;but Bingo had <i>ab-so-lute-ly</i>
disappeared!</p>

<p>Charlie and his Auntie put on their coats
and went a long distance down the road,
calling Bingo all the time, but they could
not find him anywhere. They asked everybody
that they met if they had seen a little
white dog with black spots but nobody had
seen him. Then they went home again, hoping
that Bingo would have arrived there
before them. But no, Bingo was not there!</p>

<p>Now I will tell you what happened to
Bingo. When he had run along the road
for quite a distance he came to a turning
where the road ran very steeply downhill.
There was a boy with a bob sled, and just as
Bingo reached the corner the boy lay down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
flat on his sled, and biff! off he flew down
the hill! Bingo was much excited. He
barked, &#8220;Yap, yap, yap,&#8221; and ran after the
bob sled as fast as ever he could. He was
determined to catch that bob sled! But of
course he could not. The boy and the sled
reached the bottom of the hill before Bingo,
but not long before.</p>

<p>The boy had decided to go home, as it was
near his dinner time, and he was dragging
his sled after him when Bingo arrived at the
bottom of the hill, all out of breath and with
his little red tongue hanging out. But he
was not too out of breath to jump up at the
boy and bark &#8220;Yap, yap, yap!&#8221; He was
trying to tell him how glad he was that he
had caught up with him at last.</p>

<p>The boy patted Bingo on the head and
talked to him, but of course he did not know
his name as he lived quite a distance away
and had never seen Bingo before.</p>

<p>Bingo liked the boy very much and decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
that he would go for a walk with him.
So he followed after him. It was a long,
long walk, but at last they arrived at the
boy&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>It was a tall brick house very much larger
than the house in which Bingo lived with
Charlie; and it had to be larger too, because
a great many people lived in it&mdash;two families
lived on every floor!</p>

<p>The boy climbed up five flights of stairs;
he lived on the top floor of all&mdash;and Bingo
followed after him.</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s Mother was cooking dinner in
the kitchen and she was very much surprised
when she saw Bingo. She said, &#8220;Who is
that dog?&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;I found him and
I am going to keep him for my dog. I have
always wanted one.&#8221;</p>

<p>But his Mother said, &#8220;How can we keep
a dog when we live five flights up and have
only three rooms? It is impossible. After
you have had your dinner you must take him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
back to where you found him, then he will
be able to find his way home. He has a
collar on so he must belong to somebody.
In the meantime, take him downstairs and
tie him up in the yard. I have just washed
the kitchen floor and I am afraid he will
make it dirty again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy felt very sad because he could
not keep Bingo, but he took him down to the
yard as his Mother had told him to, and he
tied him up to the fence with a piece of rope.</p>

<p>Bingo did not like this at all. He pulled
and he pulled and he pulled, but he could
not get loose. He pulled and he pulled and&mdash;he
PULLED, and&mdash;suddenly the fastening
of his collar snapped (it snapped because
Charlie had not fastened it properly
that morning), and Bingo was a free dog.</p>

<p>Then he scampered gayly out of the yard
and into the street again. He thought that
it was time to go home to Charlie and his
dinner. But&mdash;what do you think? Bingo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
could not find his way home! He ran
through street after street but he could not
find the house where he lived with Charlie
and Topsy and Jane. The boy&#8217;s Mother
must have thought that Bingo was older
than he really was when she said that he
could find his way home by himself.</p>

<p>Bingo was beginning to be worried&mdash;there
were a great many children playing in
the streets through which he passed and
every now and again he thought that he saw
Charlie, but it always turned out that he
was mistaken. Sometimes some of the children
would try to stop him but Bingo always
ran away from them. He wanted to
go home.</p>

<p>At last he passed four little boys who
were walking along together. Bingo was
very tired now and he was not running any
more; no, he was walking very slowly and
limping a little because he had hurt his foot.</p>

<p>One of the boys looked at him limping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
along in front and he said, &#8220;Look at that
puppy. He looks exactly like Charlie&#8217;s
Bingo, who does such wonderful tricks!&#8221;</p>

<p>The other boy said, &#8220;He does look like
him. Let&#8217;s call him and see if he answers to
the name Bingo.&#8221; So they called, &#8220;Bingo,
Bingo, Bingo!&#8221;</p>

<p>You may be sure that when Bingo heard
his name called <i>this time</i> he did come
running as fast as ever he could.</p>

<p>Bingo did not know the boys but they
knew him. They had often watched him
over the fence doing the tricks that Charlie
had taught him, so they knew where he lived.
Now that they were sure it <i>was</i> Bingo,
as he had come at once when they called
him, they decided that they would take him
back to his home; for they knew how unhappy
Charlie must be because he had lost
his dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image129.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>One of the strange boys held Bingo</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>But they were afraid that Bingo might
run away again, so one of the boys held on
to him while the others made a harness for
him out of some string that one of them had
in his pocket. Then they put it on Bingo
and they tied a long piece of string to the
middle of the harness for a leash.</p>

<p>So they started on their way&mdash;but you
can think how funny Bingo did look in his
rope harness! The boys could not help
laughing at him, and Bingo did not like that
at all. He had a feeling that he looked very
ragged and untidy, as indeed he did; and all
the dogs that he met and who wore beautiful
collars, sniffed at him, as though to say,
&#8220;What an extraordinary thing to wear, instead
of a collar!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bingo wished very much that he had not
lost his own collar, which was a very beautiful
one. He wanted to stop and tell the
other dogs all about it. But the four boys
were in a hurry, and they pulled at his rope
so that he had to follow them.</p>

<p>At last they reached the bottom of the hill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
that the boy had coasted down. It was ever
so much harder to climb <i>up</i> that hill than it
had been running down it that morning.
But at last they got to the top and Bingo
began to feel very excited because he recognized
the street that they were now walking
along. Every single day he walked along
that street with Charlie and Charlie&#8217;s
Mother and his Auntie on their way to the
park.</p>

<p>And&mdash;then at last they reached the garden
gate and Bingo was home! He was so
excited that he barked &#8220;Yap, yap, yap!&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie was eating his supper in the dining
room and when he heard it he said,
&#8220;That&#8217;s Bingo&#8217;s bark!&#8221; and he and his
Mother and his Auntie and his Daddy all
jumped up from the table and ran to the
front door. And&mdash;there were the four little
boys holding Bingo by the rope!</p>

<p>Well, you may be sure that everybody
was glad to see Bingo. Charlie grabbed him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
in his arms and hugged him while he thanked
the boys for bringing him home, and
Charlie&#8217;s Mother and his Auntie thanked
them also. Then Charlie&#8217;s Daddy put his
hand in his pocket and he brought out four
beautiful new quarters and he gave one to
each of the boys, so they were very happy,
too. But the happiest of all was Bingo, he
barked till he could bark no more because
he was hoarse. He barked so loudly that he
wakened Jane and Topsy from their nap
and they came out to see what it all meant.</p>

<p>When Jane saw Bingo, what do you think
she did? Why, she started to wash him!
Yes, she did; she washed him all over and he
needed it, I can tell you.</p>

<p>Then, when Bingo was nice and clean,
Charlie gave him his dinner, and when he
had eaten it he was so tired that he curled
up beside Jane on the kitchen rug, just as
if he was a baby puppy again, and went fast
asleep. But always after that, Bingo would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
come when he was called. He came so
quickly when Charlie called, &#8220;Bingo, Bingo,
Bingo,&#8221; that everybody noticed it, and said
to Charlie, &#8220;What a well-trained dog you
have. Did you train him yourself?&#8221; And
Charlie would say, &#8220;Yes, I did. He <i>is</i> a
clever dog; there isn&#8217;t <i>anything</i> that Bingo
can&#8217;t do!&#8221; And I don&#8217;t believe there was!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">WHAT CHARLIE DID ON A
RAINY DAY</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE day it was a rainy day. The rain
poured and it poured, and the wind
blew. It was a very disagreeable day. It
poured so hard that Charlie could not go out
in the yard and play in his little house. His
Mother and his Auntie both said that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
the kind of day when it is best to stay indoors.</p>

<p>Then Charlie&#8217;s Mother said, &#8220;As it is such
a rainy day that I cannot go out, I shall
make preserves all the morning. I shall
make plum preserves and orange marmalade,
and we will have some for supper to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>And his Auntie said, &#8220;I shall sew all the
morning; yes, I will make myself a nice new
dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Topsy and Bingo and Jane did not say
anything. But they all three lay down on
hearth rug and went to sleep. They had
decided that, as it was such a disagreeable,
rainy day that they could not go out and
play, they would sleep all the morning, and,
maybe, dream a nice dream about playing
in the fields in the country.</p>

<p>As for Charlie&mdash;<i>he</i> did not know <i>what</i>
to do. He stood at the window and he
looked out at the rain pattering on the ledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
and against the window pane&mdash;and he said,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do, I don&#8217;t know
what to do!&#8221; And he said it again and
again.</p>

<p>His Auntie said to him, &#8220;The very idea,
Charlie, you have <i>heaps</i> of things to do!
Why don&#8217;t you play with your toys&mdash;with
your train and with your blocks?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Charlie shook his head. &#8220;It&#8217;s no fun
playing with my train&mdash;it just goes round
and round, and I have built everything with
my blocks that I know how to build. I want
something <i>new</i> to play! Something I have
never played before.&#8221;</p>

<p>His Auntie thought hard for two whole
minutes. Then she said, &#8220;Look here,
Charlie, I have a splendid idea! You run
up to my room and bring me a pile of typewriting
paper that you will find on my desk.
Also bring a paper of pins out of my top
bureau drawer, and I will show you something
new to play with.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>So Charlie ran upstairs and brought down
these things. Then his Auntie told him to
get his own scissors with the rounded tops
and his box of colored chalks.</p>

<p>Charlie began to feel very interested and
excited. He wondered <i>what in the world</i>
his Auntie was going to do.</p>

<p>Well, when he had brought his scissors
and his crayons, his Auntie sat down at the
table and she took a piece of typewriting
paper and folded it this way and that way.
Then she colored one part of it red with the
red chalk, and she made three little green
strokes with the green chalk, and with the
scissors she cut along the creases, and folded
it some more; <i>then</i> she pinched it here and
pinched it there, and she stuck a pin in
at the back, and&mdash;there was a beautiful
little white house with a red roof and green
shutters, and a door that opened and
shut!</p>

<p>Charlie was delighted. He said, &#8220;Oh, oh!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
<i>How beautiful!</i> Show me how to make it.
<i>Please</i>, Auntie, show <i>me</i> how to make a
little house.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image139.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>So his Auntie showed him <i>ex-act-ly</i> how
to make the little house&mdash;and you will see
in the picture on this page <i>ex-act-ly</i> how
Charlie&#8217;s Auntie cut the paper, and where
she painted it red for the roof, and where
she put the windows with the green shutters,
and where she cut the door so that it could
open and shut, and where she put the pin in
at the back to keep it together. Yes,
Charlie&#8217;s Auntie used a pin instead of paste,
because paste does not always stick very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
well and it often makes things look messy
unless you are very skillful.</p>

<p>Well, after Charlie had tried several times
and his Auntie had showed him every time
where he had gone wrong, he <i>ac-tu-al-ly</i> succeeded
in making a paper house all by himself!
And it was a beautiful house.</p>

<p>When his Auntie saw that Charlie could
make paper houses just as well as she could,
she said, &#8220;Now I must go upstairs and sew
my dress, and <i>you</i>, Charlie, can make a
whole, big village of little houses, and I am
sure that you will think of some nice game
to play with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, Charlie did go on making his houses
until he had made a whole lot of them&mdash;yes,
he had made a <i>tre-men-dous</i> number of
houses; maybe he had made <i>fifteen</i> houses
out of paper, with red roofs and green doors
and shutters. Then he thought that he had
made enough and that he would like to play
with them&mdash;and so he did.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>I will tell you how Charlie played with
the houses. First he went over to a corner
of the room where there was no furniture
to get in the way and there he set up some
of his houses and made a village of them.
Then he had a <i>grand</i> idea&mdash;and the idea
was that he would like to have some trees in
his village, and he knew <i>ex-act-ly</i> how to
make them!</p>

<p>He ran into the kitchen where his Mother
was making delicious preserves and he said,
&#8220;Oh, Mother, I want some branches off the
bush near the back door&mdash;and it is <i>very important</i>.
Can I go out just for a minute
and pick some?&#8221;</p>

<p>And his Mother said, &#8220;Yes. If you put
on your rubber boots and your slicker and
your sou&#8217;wester, you can go out for just a
minute, even though it is raining, and pick
the branches you want, but you must not be
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Charlie did so&mdash;he put on his rubber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
boots and his sou&#8217;wester and his slicker and
he picked all the branches that he wanted.
When he brought them into the house he
had to shake them over the sink because
they were so wet.</p>

<p>Now I suppose you will wonder how
Charlie made those branches stand upright
on the floor to make them look like trees?</p>

<p>I will tell you. Charlie went to his box,
where he kept the old toys that he used to
play with when he was a very little boy, and
there he found a whole lot of spools. When
he was a baby he used to like to string spools
together and his Mother and his Auntie always
gave him their spools of thread when
they were bare, so Charlie had <i>dozens</i> of
spools and he sometimes let Bingo and
Topsy play with them.</p>

<p>Well, Charlie got these spools and he
stuck a small branch in the end of one of
them and stood it upright. It made a beautiful
tree! So he made a dozen trees and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
set them all along the streets of the village.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/facing143.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Charlie Made Three Villages</i></p>

<p>But there were no people in the village.
Charlie thought hard for two whole minutes&mdash;then
he went and found his old Noah&#8217;s
ark and his box of lead soldiers. Of course,
Noah and his wife and his family were the
people who lived in the village, and so were
some of the soldiers. The animals of the
ark he stood up in the fields behind the
houses and he pretended that they were all
cows&mdash;yes, he pretended that the elephants
and the giraffes and the lions and the tigers
were all cows.</p>

<p>When Charlie had finished making one
village, he started right away and made two
more, so that he had <i>three</i> villages, and each
village had a railway station. Then he
arranged his railroad track so that it went
between the different villages, and he made
his train run up and down between them.
He put some of the lead soldiers in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
coaches. And every time that his train came
to a station Charlie blew his whistle and
called out, &#8220;All out for Stony Hollow! All
out for Pine Hill! All out for Ford&#8217;s Crossing!&#8221;
and some of the soldiers got out at
every station and others got in.</p>

<p>My goodness! but Charlie did have a
good time playing with his train and with
his villages. He had such a good time that
the morning only seemed five minutes long!</p>

<p>When his Mother and his Auntie came in
to see what he had been doing with himself
all the morning, and to tell him that it was
time to get ready for dinner, they <i>were</i> surprised
and de-light-ed when they saw the
beautiful villages that Charlie had made.</p>

<p>Well, the very minute that Charlie had
finished his dinner he went back to his villages,
because he had thought of several
new ideas while he was eating his dinner.</p>

<p>Yes, he remembered a little tiny horse
and wagon that his Mother had given him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
When his Mother had given it to him there
was some candy tied to the wagon, and of
course Charlie had eaten the candy long
ago; but he had kept the horse and wagon
because it was so cunning and little, though
he thought that it was too little to play with.
But now Charlie was going to use it for his
village.</p>

<p>I wonder if you can guess what he was
going to use it for? I will tell you. Charlie
decided that the little wagon should be the
stage, and he put a lead soldier in it and
pretended that he was the stage driver.
Then he loaded the stage with little parcels
made out of paper which he pretended were
sacks of apples that the farmers of the villages
were sending to the city; and he
loaded them on to the train, and blew his
whistle&mdash;and off it started!</p>

<p>Charlie played all the afternoon with his
train and his stage and his villages; he
played with them for hours and hours. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
rain had stopped and the sun was shining
but Charlie did not notice that&mdash;until he
heard a little hoarse &#8220;Wow-wow!&#8221; outside
the door.</p>

<p>It was Bingo. Yes, Bingo had wakened
and wanted Charlie to come and play with
him. So he opened the door and Bingo
came jumping into the room, and the very
first thing he did was to knock over three
houses in Charlie&#8217;s village. And Topsy
came chasing after Bingo and <i>he</i> knocked
over four more with his tail. They would
have knocked all the houses over if Charlie
had not stopped them. But Charlie took
Bingo and Topsy out of the room and he
shut the door behind him so that they should
not spoil his village.</p>

<p>Then Charlie&#8217;s Mother called to him and
she said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you and Topsy and
Bingo run out and play in the yard? The
sun is shining, but you must put on your
rubber boots, as the grass is still wet.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>Charlie thought that it would be fun to
run around a little as he had been so busy
all day. He called Topsy and Bingo, and
they had a grand time chasing each other
around the garden and in and out of Charlie&#8217;s
little house that he had built of the
bricks that the builders had given him.
Sometimes Charlie would catch Bingo, and,
when Bingo was caught, <i>always</i> he rolled
over on his back and stuck his four legs in
the air&mdash;so that he looked ridiculous!</p>

<p>But Charlie never <i>could</i> catch Topsy.
Whenever he nearly caught him, Topsy
would just climb up a tree, and he&#8217;d climb
<i>way</i> up and peek down at Charlie through
the branches.</p>

<p>So Charlie and Topsy and Bingo played
together in the garden till Charlie&#8217;s Daddy
came home. Then, of course, Charlie had
to show his Daddy the beautiful villages
he had made, and the way each one had a
railway station, and how his train ran up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
and down the line between the stations, just
like a real train, and carried packages and
mail and passengers.</p>

<p>His Daddy was <i>most</i> interested and de-light-ed.
He was <i>so</i> interested and <i>de-light-ed</i>
that he sat straight down on the
floor, and began to play with the villages
himself. But Bingo and Topsy had to be
left in the garden while Charlie and his
Daddy were playing with the villages, because
they wanted to play also, and <i>their</i>
idea of playing with the villages was to
knock down <i>all</i> the houses and <i>all</i> the trees!</p>

<p>Well, Charlie and his Daddy played together
till supper was ready. Then Charlie&#8217;s
Mother said, &#8220;I have been making preserves
all day, and now we will eat some for
supper. I have made plum jam and orange
marmalade.&#8221; Charlie and his Daddy tasted
the plum jam and the orange marmalade&mdash;and
they both were <i>delicious</i>.</p>

<p>And what do you think? Charlie&#8217;s Auntie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
had finished her new dress and she wore it
down to supper&mdash;and it <i>did</i> look beautiful.</p>

<p>So Charlie and his Mother and his
Auntie all had a nice day after all, even
though it was such a rainy, disagreeable
kind of a day. And Topsy and Bingo and
Jane had enjoyed the day too!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
